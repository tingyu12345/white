### How We Met in Korea

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1jsXLt26oo


Hello~
Oh~ We are really going to start that way?
Hello~
Hi~
I'm late

We've actually been reading through a lot of the comments on Youtube and Instagram. A *reoccurring* question seems to be: "How did you guys meet?"

I went to Russia... I think I was five. I stayed there for four years and six months. Then I came back in 1998 to Korea and went to Korean elementary school. I didn't finish middle school in Korea; I went to India when I was 16.

Because my dad had a huge *project* in India. He was *building* a subway station, so our whole family went to India. I went to International school, American Embassy School (AES). That's how I learned *English*. Then I came back in 2008, back to Korea because I had to *join* the army.

For those of you who don't know, all men in Korea have to serve 2 years in the Korean Army. But actually, Kyuho was very very *lucky*. 

---

Yeah, I was very *lucky* because I *joined* the US Army. We call it KATUSA. That's a program where we *serve* with the US Military. So I'm actually a Korean soldier, but we just *associate* and help the US Army because they can't really *communicate* in Korea.

I think one of the major *differences* between being a regular Korean soldier and a KATUSA is that if you are just in, I don't know what you call it, the regular Korean Army, you can't leave the base. You can't leave unless they give you certain days. But since Kyuho was part of the American Army, he could come out on the *weekends*.

We actually met on one of the weekends that he was able to come out from the base.

---

Do you remember when you told me like: "Hey, I'm a KATUSA"?
Yes, I was actually very *proud* of myself. I thought she would *definitely* know about KATUSA. So, when I *came up to* her and I was *introducing* myself, I was saying like: "Hey, I'm a KATUSA, you know...".

I had no idea what that was. She had no idea what the f* that was. I met Sarah at the bar. I was with a *group* of *friends*. I was with a group of my friends too. And I was *obviously* so *nervous*. I was drinking and then I saw a lady sitting far from... you know.

---

A lady?
Yeah, I was like... DAAAAYYYYYYMMMMM!!!!
I better go talk to her, man~
I'm KATUSA. I was so *proud* and I'm almost done with *military* service. So I was full of *confidence*.

I didn't even know what the hell that was.
Yeah, I came up to her and asked: "Hey, what's up girl, what's your name?"
Oh god, if you had said that we would not be *sitting* right here doing this vlog, I'll tell you that much.

I'm just kidding. Actually, before that, she was *smiling* at me. And I *smiled* back at her. I was actually *watching* you. I saw you before you saw me.

---

Yeah. I just had to talk to her. I knew that if I didn't, then I would *regret* the whole night and *probably* my life. I had that kind of *feeling*, so I came up to her and I started to ask *questions*. So I got her *number* that night.

Oh, at that time I had that really old *flip phone*. I was so *embarrassed* to give you my *number*. He said: "I'm going to call you *tomorrow* at noon," and I was like: "Oh~ that's so nice, but yeah sure he is~". And *literally* the next day at like 12:01 PM my phone rings. And it's you.

---

Yup. I was really *surprised* because I didn't know you could speak *English*.

And I said my name is...
Well, actually, you know what...
Oh My God, I know exactly what you are going to say.

Many *foreigners* can't really *pronounce* my name. I just didn't want her to pronounce it *weird*, like KAI-HO, KIO-HO, or like Q-HOE~. I wanted to have a good *impression*, a first impression basically, that's what I wanted.

---

Oh, you had a first good *impression* alright.
Um... in the army, you know, as you know, they only go by last names. There are so many Lee's and Kim's, Park's. So normally US soldiers will just make *nicknames* for us.

And since I loved *dancing*, my First Sergeant started to call me "dancing Lee" because we had like four other Lee's. Otherwise, if you just say like "Hey Lee!" then all like five people will turn around and say "Me?".

I asked what your name was, and then I just told her: "Okay, just call me Dancing Lee," and she was like "WHAT?".

---

I don't think that name really *flies* in real life. I mean, *whenever* I tell this story to other *friends*, they just say like "You dumbass".
Oh well, I *married* her, so...

I think that all of your *friends* will make *fun of* you *posting* this story because they still *tease* you.
Yeah, I don't give a f...

If you have any *questions* or if you're really *curious* about our *relationship*, please leave a *comment*. Yeah, we have a couple of *ideas* of what kind of *videos* we want to make with *regards* to answering questions. But if there are any other *specific* ones that you guys are really curious about...

---

So, thanks for *watching*.
Thanks for watching.
And please send us your *questions*.
Bye~
