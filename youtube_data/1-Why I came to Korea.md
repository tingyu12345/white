We're doing the last *finishing* touches on moving out. I cannot believe we lived here as long as we did.

Having fun?
Ohhhh ~
Oh gosh~
Hi~ Hello~ Hey

Now I'm even scared to say "Hey Guys~". Let's please use that.
HEEEEEY~
Hey guys~
Well hello!

*Welcome* to our new apartment! If you guys saw the last video, you will see how tiny tiny tiny our other apartment was. And we *actually* have a little *veranda* and we actually have a view outside! Finally we can see outside where we can see the sky and the sunlight, because my other apartment...


I looked out the window and I just saw concrete - just basically the wall from the next apartment building over. And that's why my tree died.

This apartment is probably not so big as you expect. In Seoul, basically people live in teeny tiny apartments because it's Seoul. The real estate is *incredibly* *expensive*. Yes, very expensive. It's an *enormous* city, but the space is also very, very *limited*, especially these days.

*Anyway*, so we will show you around.

Okay, so this is all of our beautiful closet space. And then we've got our kitchen.

And this is a real size *refrigerator* which we're so excited about, because the one at our old place was about... I don't know, about this big.

We bought a printer. Yeah, this is our whole little station area that we *purchased* very recently. I'm so excited to get to the end. I brought my computer from my house. It's my table.

Well, this is your section, Sarah!
So, this is the part that I'm the most excited about because I've wanted a *vanity* for as long as I could remember. And this one is really, really cool - it actually has LED lights in it~

This is one of my favorite things I've ever purchased in my whole life, and I'm so excited about it.
Weeeeee~

And Kyuho got really bored while I was filming my vanity, so he is just playing around here.

As you saw my poor *pitiful* little dead tree in our last apartment video, Kyuho bought me a new little plant for our new start here~

Okay, we actually have a very large lovely window here.
Mmmm, I love chocolates~
Hello~
Hi!
So we are finally moved in to our apartment, as you guys can see. And we've been reading a lot of questions over the past couple of weeks.

We've been thinking maybe at the end of each video, we will kind of have a short question & answer session. So rather than make just one video and rush through a whole bunch of answers at once, we kind of wanted to take our time and answer *in detail*.

Yeah, answer more *in detail* - maybe one or two questions per video.

---

The first question will be: *"Why did you come to Korea?"*

Why did I come to Korea? We've gotten a lot of this one.

So yes, I came to Korea in 2011. I guess this kind of starts off with when I was in my first year of university in Canada.


I studied *abroad* in Japan for like a summer *homestay* program. And I kind of made up my mind that I am going to go back to Japan when I *graduate* to teach English there, because I had such a great time and I had a wonderful *host family*. And I really learned a lot.

When I graduated, you know, my mind was set - I was going to go to Japan. I was just looking for a program. I was researching and I *realized* that Korea also had a lot of *perks* too when it comes to teaching English.

Sorry.

I actually met several Korean friends at university.


Some of my friends managed to *convince* me to give Korea a try instead. And I was like "Okay, I'm going to go to Korea for 1 year, and then as soon as my *contract* is finished, I'm going to go to Japan."

And then I met this guy.

And let me just say this - when I came to Korea, I had this *mindset*: I was not interested in meeting anyone-- I mean any guy. I was not interested in being *involved*. I didn't want to be in a relationship. This was going to be like my year about me. I want to work abroad, I want to travel. I don't want to get involved in any messy relationships... nothing.

---

And then three months in, that all went to shit. I mean not to shit, but you know, it was all good.
Ah, too late~
I actually came here really for my own *growth* and journey, but I ended up marrying somebody special.

But the funny part is, my mom when I left for Korea, she actually *jokingly* said to me: "Oh, you will probably meet a beautiful Korean man and get married over there." And I was like "Whatever, mom, I don't want a relationship. I don't have time for man right now - it's just for me."

Well, you were right, mom.

---

So we will continue to answer questions like this at the end of each video. So the more questions you guys post, then more we can pick from there. Keep posting questions - we will always check and we will also try to answer all these questions *in detail*. We're always checking them.

Alright. So.... Bye~~
