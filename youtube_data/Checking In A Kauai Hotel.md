## 開場介紹
Hello everyone! Oh my hat is *crooked*. This is B from Bose's Slow English and you are watching I'm not sure which video but it's a Hawaii vlog series and we are *approaching* our next hotel on the island of Kauai and I can't wait to show you. I love this *neighborhood* so far. 

Before I show you, please like this video to show your *support* and please click subscribe so we can be friends.

## 飯店入住
We are checking in to our hotel. Aloha! Oh look at all the Audi's that we can drive around.

*前台對話：*
"Aloha, welcome to the one hotel, how may I assist you?"
"And first name Bo, B-O."
"Thank you sir, and just the two of you?"
"Yes."

"So there are some Audi cars over here in the parking lot. Are we celebrating anything?"
"Our anniversary."
"Happy anniversary!"
"Thank you, you're welcome. Are we able to rent those Audi's?"
"Yes, those are available for rent. The valet and the front desk will tell you how everything works."
"Okay, okay great, thank you."

## 小秘密分享
Okay you guys, I have to tell you a secret. *Anytime* we are asked if there is a *special occasion*, we always say that it's our anniversary because they always give some sort of little treat.

Um, so if we are able to rent those Audi's, was there a need for us to rent this rental car? This is what happened when we were in Napa - we rented a car and we ended up using the hotel's car the whole time.

We're going to get out of the car. I have a big coconut in my lap from the last episode when we pulled over on the side of the road to get some fresh coconut and we are about to check in. We just dropped our car off with the valet.

## 飯店大廳初印象
Here we are. Do you think I will ever get to the point where these hotels will pay me to film here? Let's make that a goal for me. Isn't this a beautiful *entrance*? It's super clean here. We're heading up to the *reception* area to check in. Oh it smells really nice.

"Is this where we're checking in?"
"This is our check-in area."
"Hi, is it okay that I film a little? I'm teaching English."
"Yeah."

So we are here at the uh oh check-in, sorry just dropped the coconut. It's all done, yeah thank you. I can definitely do. I have never been to a hotel reception where you check in in this little like bungalow.

## 歡迎飲料
Welcome *beverages* at check-in. This *consists* of a passion orange guava juice with a side shot of coconut rum.

"Yeah great, I guess so. We're going to have to have some rum and while I make those drinks for you, if you could just get your IDs ready for me and the credit card."
"Is the credit card just for incidentals?"
"Okay."

Let's watch him make these beverages. Oh yeah, we're good.

*調酒師解說：*
"Can you tell me again, you're getting filmed, so yes, this the orange juice is the passion orange and guava juice and then the clear substance is our Koloa coconut rum which is island made as well too and you can purchase this at any of our local convenience stores as well."
"Thank you, very cool."

This is right after I said I don't drink alcohol much. Wow, I didn't even look behind me, this hotel is huge.

## 品嚐飲料
"Now if you haven't tasted these flavors just yet, I would suggest just taking a sip of both just so that you can see what the flavors are and tell you and then you can either decide to shoot it or mix it, okay?"
"Right now, so the shots first and then the other one's the chaser I guess?"
"Yeah, okay, okay, shot first."

Give a little bit of a mix. I'm going to try the mix first. I have no idea why I just sniffed that. It's strong, it's really good though, the coconut flavor. Wow, all right, I'm just going to go for it. Cheers!

It's amazing how the juice washes down the alcohol really fast. I would like to say that the juice is a little bit *dangerous* because if it goes down smooth, anything alcoholic that goes down smooth is really dangerous. Yeah, that's kind of the story with soju, you know, the Korean alcohol.

"Do you like it?"
"No, I just had to tell me what's your secret?"
"Uh, the secret to a happy marriage is giving each other personal space, I think it's space, patience. She does a lot of vlogging too so I kind of do my own thing while she does her background."

## 飯店導覽開始
All right, so we have our bellman taking us on a tour. We have a *souvenir* shop, it's a really nice shop. Oh that's a cute top, I might go shopping. Ooh, nice, wow, I just started, this is the job, I'm a month.

We are heading through the reception area. They *upgraded* our room to an ocean front because we told them that it is our anniversary. Hello, aloha!

This restaurant is like the dinner only restaurant and they do sushi and sushi bar, cool.

## 與工作人員的閒聊
"Are you part Asian? No, you kind of look like it right?"
"Yeah, that's cool, I like, I like your... If you see my son you would definitely think so as well."
"Oh really, so what's your wife's *ethnicity*?"
"Uh, Italian, okay, but also like we always have this joke that there's probably more to her story too because she looks also very, like you wouldn't guess she would have... interesting. And then all I know about my story is my grandfather was Cherokee, oh, but then there's all this other *mystery* of like my background, so maybe that's where that's kind of Asian. Yeah, my son has like really low eyes, you know, blonde hair, but me and my lady don't have blonde hair."
"Sounds so cute, yeah, I'll show you, I'll show you."

## 繼續導覽
"The tour, this is the spa's backyard. I don't know if you want to go in, you want to take... We're going to go on Wednesday so yeah, we're good, yeah, thank you."

"Spot there, down here is one kitchen, down here breakfast, lunch and dinner, and then also these stairs also lead to where the gym is, basically down the stairs to the other end of the hallway."

## 海景與海灘
This view is crazy! I know right, I want to go on one of those boats out there. Whoa, wow!

"Is this a private hotel beach?"
"So this beach is public, okay, but it is on the *grounds* of the hotel, but there are people who come from different... like there's another hotel down the road, people come from to the beach there. So there are some areas though that are down here that are more... it's not private *technically*, but not a lot of people know about them. When you get down there you kind of explore a little bit."

"So down there you have the beach, then there's also a bigger pool down there for everyone, and then over here you have the adult only pool."
"Oh cool."
"It's an infinity pool and then behind it there's a bar and then the little bedding there or the beds, is that first come first serve or do you have to reserve?"

"Good question, I love getting new questions that I don't know the answer to, but I think though, I'm pretty sure there is a reservation process involved. We'll figure it out, but since you're a guest I think you get high priority."

## 對環境的驚嘆
The water is more beautiful than I imagined. Yeah, we... I mean I thought it was going to be ugly like LA.
"Really? Yeah, you really thought that?"
"LA is gross, yeah, and it's definitely way warmer than LA water is as well."
"Oh good."

"Oh, is that a little garden?"
"Yeah, yeah, it's an herb garden, nice."

"And this is Hanalei Bay, this Hanalei Bay, okay. And so the town Hanalei is kind of hidden by these trees, but it's basically behind where these trees are kind of blocking it. It's a small town and yeah, it used to be not much going on, sleepy town, and then slowly it's turned into a pretty big like *tourist hub*, very cool."

"So yeah, if you do end up taking a trip off the *property*, I definitely highly recommend Hanalei or just Hanalei."

## 房間導覽
Wow, this upgraded room is crazy, let me show you. It's like a studio apartment here, maybe even bigger than a studio. Hi!

*衣櫃區域：*
So in these closets we can hang up our clothes. "Hang up" is a great phrasal verb. We will probably set our suitcase on this bench.

*臥室：*
And here is the bed, this looks like a king-size bed. And on here is a *personalized* note, it says "Aloha Kim! Ohana, here are your requested pillows, have an amazing stay."

So when I booked this hotel, I *requested* for foam pillows because the feathered pillows that normally come *standard* hurt my neck, so I need additional support.

*房間設施：*
Here we have a drone which we need to figure out where to fly this drone. This bag is my toiletry bag. I love that they have a filtered water station so we can refill our water bottles. Here are the room keys.

This hotel chain, they are known to be *sustainable*, which means that all of this wood that you see here is *recycled*, amongst other materials that you see throughout the hotel.

## 房間景觀
And now the view! Oh my gosh! Here's a couch to lounge around on, and here is the view. Isn't this amazing? This is the adult only pool and the restaurant is over here. That is Hanalei Bay and some sun chairs, or actually they're called chaise, which is a French word for chair. A huge TV.

## 浴室導覽
And I'll show you the bathroom. This is the toilet and double sinks. That's key to a hotel because I hate when there's a *lack* of counter space. There's plenty of space below.

And look at this bathtub! It's a marble bathtub *overlooking* the bay! Oh, and this is also the shower, so the shower and bathtub are in the same little room.

## 結尾
And that is the tour of our hotel room. Don't forget to like and subscribe. I have hat hair. "Hat hair" means that my hat squished my hair and now it looks really messy, but I'm going to unpack and then I will film later.
