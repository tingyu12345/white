### Human Design: Energetic Self-Understanding


## 逐字稿

Ascension. But before you can achieve the ascension (提升), you have to let go. Let go your worry. Let go your money. Sometimes I lost a lot of money. Let go of the attachment for somebody or something. 

Not everybody needs to go through the ascension process like I did. But eventually everybody will have a process to return to who you are like your **innocent** child. We are all becoming conditioned that "I have to be successful, I have to be beautiful, I have to be this..." This list goes on and on because we want to be accepted, right? But acceptance needs to come from here. If you don't accept yourself, you just mold yourself to somebody's expectation. Eventually, you feel empty.

So this whole thing is just to tune you, to tell you what you are energetically. Not like "what is that," but to read the energetic field. We have nine different centers based on this system for human design system. But this is not only just coming out from nowhere, it's four ancient systems. 

So I sent that to you guys. I'm not sure later maybe you guys can... and we'll see. So this talks about the four systems combined in this energetic system. Each is 6 or 8 thousand years ago. Interested to find the background? The second one is the Kabala. We might not know Kabala is ancient wisdom about the ascension process. We are coming down here to be a human body, but we are not what we see. Who we are energetically is not what we see. So then there's a process to call you back to home. That's the ancient depth. 

The other one is the chakra. If you practice yoga, meditation, you know they want you to calm down, to ground yourself, right? That is your frequency in your body. Everything's frequency based on 21st century science. I'm a scientist. 

What they mean is this is the energy at certain frequencies that we can see as color, right? Every cell is light vibrating at different frequencies. So we can see the differences, but they are not forever in this form. Before this wood existed, it was seeds, but they are all following the same energy pattern. They just transformed into different forms. So that is - everything is energy.

That is actually the universal law. The first law you need to know. It's not like Newton's, it's not like scientific law. The universal law means the first one is the law of frequency. As I say, our eyes can only see a narrow spectrum of the lights - the color, the wavelength. We cannot see beyond what we can see. It's like a spectrum our eyes can perceive. That's frequency there. 

But in the main, something we don't see doesn't mean there's nothing there. Can you see microwave? No.
Can you see radio waves? Are they there? Yeah. 

So right now we begin to understand we are limited. Our body, our senses, always just choose to see a certain range. Outside of that range things exist, but we don't know, and yet our body knows. See, if you're sensitive enough, you go to a room like this - quiet - and automatically you feel sad. You don't have a reason to feel sad, but their vibration - the low vibration sadness - comes into your body. So you feel it.

Energy takes different forms, but our body can tell while our mind not necessarily can. Our mind is really logical, right? We only say, "Oh, if I don't have a reason, I shouldn't feel sad." But you just feel sad - you just don't have any reason. So your mind will direct us to different functions and judgments.

That's why we need to know our body so we can balance. Yes, my mind says "you are this, this" but my body tells me a different story. So we have to understand they are all telling the truth. That's different ways to tell you the information. So the brain will tell you what's wrong, what's the problem you have to solve, what are the differences. So you feel nervous, pressured, depressed because you don't know, you don't feel you have a solution. Your mind lowers your depth so you become worn, saying things to make you feel okay. They have to do their work, they have to tell you some differences - a little for purpose. That's the brain.

But our body... your heart is connected to everything. Ants, animals, rocks - everything around you is connected energetically. So if you allow your heart to calm your mind... 

[Excuse me, so we can have more seats. Faster. No, no. I mean move together to... so open. Yeah, open there. Nice. It's not good. No problem. No problem.]

But anyway, the first law is lower frequency. Understand frequency is everything. In Africa, totally up to earth, but how I studied a lot, very impressive for... So in that darkness I'm searching Bible, everything - I learn psychology. You know, I always just attend the conferences and I will be happy. No one can be truly happy. So happy, yeah.

That's because I'm in the very low because I don't feel I can be free without happiness. But one day I'm just like, "Well, which way I didn't go? Oh, go find a solution. Find a home." So I said, "Why is there still something outside of me?" The only thing I really need to know is who I am, why I'm here. That question is always there. But I never had the courage to face myself, right? But when I finally decided I want to change my life, I want to learn the language of the universe. This one is supposed to come to me to use. Like, "What is this? I don't want to learn a new thing. Nothing works, right?" I'm very threatened.

So my story is inside. I'm going to eat something here. What is in the cloud? What can I prove? All these questions are running, but this is just practice for us to find out we are not what we think we are.

Until first between different colors of our body, our whole resonates certain things in our system. We have the ancient system - your energy. You can listen to different frequencies of music and you can tune into that frequency. 

Then in science, for example, they put all those ticking clocks in the whole room in front of me. In 10 minutes, everybody talks when the frequencies around the room are different, but eventually universe will harmonize them.
When you're in environments causing you some disturbance, that is not permanent. Just remember that. You feel something you don't like, but that doesn't mean you are bad. You can't say "I'm unhappy" - no, you FEEL unhappy. You are not equal to unhappy. See the definition? Sometimes we limit ourselves: "I'm nobody" - but you can say "I feel like nobody." So that realization can start to let you shift your mind to different perspectives.

Before, you always feel this negativity, problem-solving, comparison, worry, fear. But now you know that's just part of the shift. But in order to shift it, you have to know who you are, what you can do. You have to regain your confidence. You have to regain your connectivity.

It's in order to flow with the law. If you're always against the law - of course, you are against the train. The water going this way means you're going against it. How about turn around, flow with it, and observe everything and learn the new skill? That's how I got out myself. Show gratitude for everything I experience. The person, the event... my son died in the past at 27 years old. You cannot [communicate] that long, but he's still very talkative at events. He plays games with his brother. He [communicates] through his photo, his eyes - his eyes, our eyes. That's why he has technology very high for people like him. You can use the light to open the door and operate spirituality.

So I observe that - oh, it's really powerful. And also the determination about... I just every day we wake up to the mirror like, "Hey, there's another day to play." Even when he's peaceful, just looking at me. It's not just really like one breath away, but we didn't start life - it's just one breath away. And I don't have any different energy - it's not gone, it's just different.

So that lower frequency - you master that because we don't know. We don't know what we don't know, right? But we don't need to [judge]. Oh, they are gone because they cannot connect us physically, but energetically, everybody's connected because you couldn't separate your energy from me, right? That's why when COVID hit, everybody had a sense [of connection]. Did you feel more calm because we need to be based on people? 

So if you - like this person - has an open center, I will talk about that as three open centers. That means other people's energy can just influence, get in and get out. You have no idea, but you have to know yourself in the way of "Oh, I don't need to worry about it, it's somebody else." So you can sit there and sip your cup of tea, don't worry about it, and try to figure out, "What is wrong with me? Why do I have this idea? Why do I feel stress?" There might be somebody else's energy, maybe yours, I don't know, right? But it's just talking about energy becoming...

So just let it be, let it grow. It means don't concern yourself only. Don't "not care" about others. It's don't say "don't care" - it's like you have to have compassion about the feeling you have for yourself. If that's coming from somebody who suffers, and you feel they suffer, so if you have compassion for yourself, you have compassion for that person. The energy is sharing and not doing.

Yeah. But the difference is when things happen, the first reaction is "Yeah, solve it, solve it." It's not easy to control.
Yeah. That's why we got problems. That's called conditioning. Conditioning is like when you are small, everybody - like your teacher, your parent, your sibling - they have a certain way to deal with emotions. They have [certain patterns]. We eat their food. We learn because we need to fit in, right? So we learn, but not necessarily fit in with our true design.

So human design systems get you to not bring others' [patterns], but bring you this mystery life. It's like I allow it to happen. If I know myself, I don't spend more time to deal with that. I just say, "That's your idea. I respect that. I don't have any idea there, but that's your idea. I have to think about it."

So [create] boundaries. If you always just say "yes, yes, yes" - just a little bit like me when I was young - so depressed but said yes to everything. "I'm a good student," you know. And that's about why I was still suffering. So even if you're more angry... but if you know who you are, you might have a temporary [situation] where people don't like it, you know, you don't have friends, but your new friends will come in because we always meet people at the same time. Then you start to grow together.
So I learned from experiences, and you guys get together with you guys, really connecting the people together and share knowledge. So today, this one is really not just saying this one fixes... nothing can fix until we decide to be fixed. You agree with that because when I was like totally angry, saying "Be happy" won't fix anything because I tried everything. But because I denied that first - I cannot be fixed - but now I know yes, I cannot be fixed but I have to accept first. When they say "I want to fix it," that means you admit you have problems, right?

But I'm not perfect. If I accept, say, "Yeah, what's the [problem]? I don't like it, so what?" Now your confidence starts to take over this way of doubts. Then you just live the way you feel the most aligned with yourself. Then your friends you don't like - they'll be gone. Whatever influences your life, gives you a lot of pressure, they will for some reason just disappear like it's all gone. 

But then you have to accept and new way of opening contact. So sometimes we don't feel comfortable because we like to... a lot of people get stuck in the stress level because they don't know if they're better to stay in the place that we feel comfortable. But sometimes in our life, you really weigh up. Your energy field starts to have a way to accept the new. You can adjust it. You're just like a radio when you need a low [frequency] - cannot hear the sea. You just fine tune it until you can hear it's very clear directions. Even if you cannot hear, you can feel that's feel good and feel harmonized - the decision stuff like that. So this will teach you the strategies.

Then once you experience the higher vibrations, you can see the world differently. You see different colors, you sense things you've never seen. Like you're so busy, you walk by roses, never look at the roses that were always going to be there. But when you are at higher vibration, you can sense the little details that are just there. You just look at it, "Oh, I think that is weird." So you start to look at the little things about you. That's indicating your higher feelings because you can sense other things and focus on them.

So hopefully once you are curious about the system, then read some books or go out and check it out and start to play with it. It's really an experimental system. Then if you notice you start to feel more at ease and sleep better, smile to people - that means you are on the right track. But you still like to stay with familiar talent, which maybe is not necessarily who you are. Maybe you judge yourself too fast. Why people can't be safe? No, it's not your problem. It's really your mind is too tight. You have to let it go slowly. The other thing is everybody notices the world is changing, right? There are just so many things - in the past we thought it was common sense, now it's not common sense. People do something we don't understand. So that's transition. We're going to a different background frequency. So when the background frequency changes, your mind and our behavior start to change. 

Before this change, we were logical, very powerful, everything had a system. But we are transferring to a very free, wide-range society. So people like us - very logical - we will have difficulty adapting to that.

So this system actually, I call it - it's got four different systems. So the outside is the I-Ching, right? It's 64 - each one has six lines and number one to 64, and that's the Hindu [system]. So if you know there is a Chinese way... have you heard that before?

What does that mean? When I first [heard it], I had no idea. It's like, so long... what's the relationship? But this is actually connection. So when we are moving around, doing our things, we have to be grounded, right? We have to - we cannot really fly yet - we are staying right here, so we connect with the earth. So when the earth has certain feelings, they're coming from the system. And at the top we have [astrology]. Right. Every planet has a frequency in it. Why they want soft people? Because they're easy to [influence]. Yeah. Have you watched the movie The Matrix? Right.
No [specific] information. It's just a movie. But it's similar to what we experience. These four [systems] are circles - they don't move, they are at angles. So 64 minus the four, that's 60, right? 360 [degrees]. So each six will move to a different number. So when they move, actually this frequency is different. 

So they download to us - 70% of the people. We all have our own health center. So we can receive the information from above. Those we call "explanations." So it's not an idea, it's explanation. They are in the correctness of this or that - don't do this, do that. Sometimes people who are sensitive can hear those directions.

My mother did, yes. Someone can do that, right? Yes, for a very short period of time. So like... we don't know, so we kind of think it's weird how they can do that psychic or something we call it. But it's because of the design. Everybody is designed energetically differently. Somebody is easy to connect to the voice, agent, sound that has... 

But this is not something I'm saying just for you to accept something the science couldn't explain. Like, a lot of science can explain how we can do that. That's because we've all been trained so many years to think about one structure. The experts said that. So other things in science - now you move to the different era - frequency starts to change. We will start having more people accept those things - untouchable, invisible - because those things are coming. So those of us who are very rigid in the back left brain, we need to have an adaptation process.

So this is the tool for us to understand why I feel this. Know it's nothing wrong with my body, my mind, but it's just my mind wants to go back to... so that is the system, okay? Astrology [is one part], and the I-Ching [is another]. The ascension process is like: we're coming here to explore the earth, but we are energetically beings, so we are energetically - we have some connection with...

This is part of the system. The outside is the I-Ching and Kabala together, so they give you kind of GPS. Like I-Ching actually is the code for your life - just like when you book a trip, you go to a place. You're an energetic being, so beautiful - you go down here because the earth is much lower, so you have to do that. So you're down in here, then you have to have [guidance], otherwise you'd be confused.

So GPS - GPS is your map, they give you the path. So when you come here, maybe you like [it], but that's not you. So don't get too attached to that identity. But then you understand your identity is different from whatever you want to go.

It's true. How do we know that it's not you? That's why you have to feel uncomfortable. Your body will tell you. So you can trust your body. Your body feels numb or something - it's not yours. Don't find a doctor. Don't accept that information. 

What I'm trying to say? Okay. Sometimes because my gesture is not in the right position. Yeah. So it's not about the stress because my judgment doesn't have... you have to sit down.
Because your brain function is to compare, but your body can tell you, "Oh, you sit the wrong way so you feel sore." Things will be different. Yeah. Particularly those things the doctor cannot fix. 

A lot of people have solid symptoms that can become stubborn. I said, "No, I have a problem," so it's not that simple, right? So I need... Yeah, that's the other thing is - we still trust ourselves. We can feel ourselves. 

When you have a problem, you can just [address] that way. But if there's just a little discomfort, that's the time to communicate. I'm not judging you. A lot of people...

No, I'm going to call your legs "not good." You know why I'm this one and that one? The frequency is so [misunderstood by] science. When you meet a low frequency, your body [creates] protection so they cannot hear you. Only high frequency you can hear. 

So how to lift or raise your [frequency]? 

Just detach from all the... don't find anything until you start to just play with memories, beliefs. So if you live in the [low frequency] field, your body eventually starts to remind you: "You live in the low frequency, you're going to have this [problem]" and you still don't want them. The disease - you can only use the medicine to maintain, not heal.

So when you can really heal yourself, do it - raise your frequency. Then even if you need to see the doctor, really heal yourself. 

So many cases of cancer patients - what do they do? They go for fun, and they come back [healthy] because they don't worry about "Oh, I'm going to die, I have cancer." You know, all the negative people, they think, "Oh, I only have like two-three months to live, let's have fun." Then you raise [your frequency], and you don't worry about it.

So that is really about the physical body. But this is not to say this is the [only] tool. This is the tool for you to [understand] chapters, getting inside. 

Then I'll list about the nine centers. This is anticipation to tell you this because these are the nine centers from the top to the bottom, and they are energy centers - they actually have different functions. So if you have a posterior profile, you have...

Yeah, the other [centers]... Yeah, this is the human design chart I'm talking about. That's the [diagram] - that is your GPS. But this is your body. This is our energetic body. Everybody's different. 

So you will have open centers, you have divine centers. In the open center, you always have more influence by others. But if you have a color in this divine center, then you are more bonded, know who you are. 

But that's just going back to - you have to start to explore. But this one says everything about the energy - the energy will decide, determine your psychology. So this will talk about psychology too. 

So for certain people - it doesn't... I don't even know you. I don't need to hear your story. I don't [need to], it's not because I know the system. 

So you don't need to heal other people, but as long as you can understand - of course I cannot teach all of this today, but eventually I will have a course to talk about psychology and your diet. Your diet is energy too. 

So if you don't know your body type, maybe you're [eating at] the wrong timing. You can do everything to lose weight and [still not succeed].

So this is a book I found out - maybe just what I read, maybe it's in English. So I [found] this book, so I came here, I read... So very simple. This talks about the gates like this, the connection or something - what that means, how you can deal with your daily life. 

So this is going to be a reference - go to the library or... You cannot [fully understand] what they want to learn. But if I can say - we come down from the [higher realm]. Being decides to come, we come down. We need to have a body to take on the [earth], right? 

So the body is like a car. Like we [drive] the car. The body is a car. So the body has a lot of [perspectives], things [like a] car. About who's driving the car?

Mind. Yeah. It's the ego. 

This ego wants something, desires something, they [pursue] something. So they have their logical thinking. That's the ego's drive. Then your soul is like a passenger. It should just be like, "Hey, drive over there." If that is perfect... But we don't want [that], so we are always saying something, but that's not fun for the ego. Ego is driving. 

So if the passenger is not awake, [the passenger is] dreaming. They are suffering. They don't care what's outside, and the ego takes you to a place [it chooses] because they have their own conditioning. It depends on culture. You have [acquired] it through generations. 

So you let the ego take [control], but our essence is not that. We should combine with our ego. We didn't [create] our ego. So we are still the master. Ego is not a master. If you listen to your mind, that means you're not [in control]. You let your mind [control you]. 

But not everybody can do this [separation]. It's just the system suggests that is the correct scenario. You are... You know, the [true] kind of [self], right? So you relax, you feel more radiance and happy. It's not because you spend the money, right? It can be, but actually [when you're] away from [ego control], you are more yourself. 

So when you're more relaxed, more calm, more happy, and you relax yourself in different energetic [states], it's a point of generating. We try to generate something called "generator." Generator wants to work. So we create a lot of energy. 

But when a generator is not working on something [appropriate]... So if you work on something for so long, always [feeling] frustrated, that might not be the focus your body tells you to do. This conditioning - "I don't care, [I'm going] to do [it anyway]."

So you're all going to do it. And the second type is called "projector." If you clear your profile, you got projector. I... you are generator. Producer. Producer. Yeah. 

So you always have a lot of energy. You want like a little [push], you know, and the more you go far, you feel more energetic. The number is different. Yeah. Different type of one to six. So your combination is five and four. Yeah. Two and four. Two and four is more... and six. Four and six. You're on four and six. Working hard.

So generators are all about working hard. But if you work on the wrong thing, you feel frustrated. So if you feel satisfied, contentment is the energy worth pursuing. 

So if you choose something, okay, "I want to do this." But then after doing it - "Why am I doing this? I get frustrated." This is a lot of complaint. That's just like - you should find a way to get out. This is not what we need to do. 

And sometimes things are just so hard. So how to... I mean, sometimes things are just so hard. So how is like... um, is this thing not right for me? Or is this thing just hard and we need to...

So you need to take a break. If you take a break, come back, and you still feel frustrated, it's just... Yeah, just like temporary - everybody has temporary stress, that's fine. But with prolonged time, you know, more than 5 years? Forget about it, right?

And the second type is projector. The generator - you generate. The population: 70% is generators because we need energy, we need to build something. 

So we've got 20% Projectors. Projectors don't have any energy center - this one, projector [sacral center]. So the center is called sacral life force. Life force - projectors don't have it. So they have to borrow energy from generators. A projector needs to have a generator nearby. That's why 70% are generators.

But projectors - they usually can see somebody's heart. So projector is the best manager. They connect to others through the heart, not by [force]. But they have to take care of themselves. Sometimes they [get] so close... 

Other projectors know your [nature]. When you are a projector, you strive for success because you want everybody to be successful. That's your trait.
But when you don't have a successful feeling, you're just like, "We can do the research." Projector is the future manager because we are... But you can see like this project - "I want to do this." 

So [focus on what] you've got energy for. Let me ask you, and that is over. Your talent: Don't chase people. I know, I know this - nobody will listen to you. 

So the third type is about 7% or 9% - called "manifestor" in English. Manifestation - we all like man, money, but the manifestors - they don't [need others]. They can take initiative, but they leave the work together in creative [ways].

They are initiated creators - like Elon Musk. They have very novel ideas, then the generator will make it into practice and become a product. Yeah, that's right - a lot of leaders, the past leaders, they are all manifestors. They can be good. So we can change the world very quickly. 

And then the last type is called "reflector." Reflector really totally doesn't have any [defined centers] in the center. So their information is all coming from others. So they are very [changeable] because they don't [have stability]. 

But today I feel I'm more like Tim, and tomorrow, "Oh, I like Sunny." So who am I? So they are always [absorbing] other people's [energies].

But because they are separate, they were easy to see outside of the... like the [awareness] is only [around] 50%, so anybody follow the big feelings [appears] similar. But then because projectors can feel differences, like today she says her [feeling] and tomorrow she can say "Oh, different!" 

So she knows this is not her, because we change overnight. So she becomes more [in] flow with whatever, and they don't need to restrict [themselves].

But the caveat to that is they don't know the direction they [need to] do, right? 

But these four different beings together in the perfect society will be: 
- The initiator (the manifestor) says "Let's build the peaceful world," right? 
- Then the generator says "Good idea, let's do it." 
- The projector says "Let me manage you guys - do this, you guys do that. Let me practice this." 
- The reflector says "Let me observe who is not doing their job."

So the perfect thing is to say we're the doers with the work, but not because we want to be - and that is because we have 70% generators. Most of us [are] not doing [our true work], so we are all [suffering]. 

So the projectors feel bitter. So every energy type - many feel they are not doing their job. So they don't like [it]. They do this and people say nothing. [They] do something, do so much, then look at what they get. They don't know what's going on - they're just so confused. They don't get what they do.

This is a [profile] and this is... The number is just higher coordinates [in] the different system, but it's the same. So the I-Ching. 

So here is the [body graph], right? It's body [chart] here. So the I-Ching is the one with the message. We're coming down like it's [becoming] our system until we start. 

So we get into these feelings and what do we one day understand? Green color, red color. So green color for you is... That means you finally realize, "Oh, I got some tool. I never knew. Let's open the box to see what those things help to get out."

So that is your genius. Your primary gift, the gift - and they have three different spectrums. You see that [shadow], then you have a gift. You have the [light]. 

But I want to ask a very kindergarten question: How can we make a shadow? Shadow. How do we make a shadow against the sun? Yeah. 

So you need to have objects. Object. Then the light. Light. The shadow. Yes. Right. So this is what we are. We are together with the light. Shadow. But we can adjust the conscious a little bit. You can stay in the shadow like 20 seconds, or you can turn around and face the light. Right?

So [the system] doesn't want you to study. It just wants you to change your perspective, directions. So if each sphere has three different spectrums, then you start and play with it. 

For example, I have one, two [qualities]. So then when shadow is agitation, so I feel like "I need to do something" - you know, that's agitation, right? 

But if I can make that energy become focused and I take the initiative - since my house is such a mess, I got this extra medicine, let's clean - so you turn that agitation into some kind of action. 

But the action could be productive or destructive or chores. I can go out and touch the tree. I can clean the house, whatever I want to do with the agitation. 

But then you take initiative - once you train yourself, it's easy to flow from shadow to the positive actions. Then eventually your adjuster and the highest one is awakening. 

So once I train myself knowing I have this energy I can direct it the way I choose to, then it's easy to understand I'm doing this awakening. It doesn't mean like awakening is where you're going to get this and all of a sudden "Oh, I can do that!" That's an awakening. 

So don't be brainwashed that I have to be Jesus, have to do something spiritual. This can happen the way you like but you need practice. That's how you can use all the fear, all the different shadows that go lower.
Yeah. So that's your lower frequency. So psychosis - that's why you always think about too far. You always just find the reason. You want to solve the problem. 

So you always just think "why that happened to me?" Everybody's like that. Who is that? Think about the problem. We all think about the problem. So that is shadow. It doesn't mean they think it's like a human behavior. We are, but you can turn that worrying, doubts into inspiration. 

So let's just have fun. Let me just inspire yourself. So your energy moves up in the highest one - sensitivity, sensitivity. Yeah. That is one. 

So that light is always there. So we are... So like all the things, they just say "Oh, I'm this or that" but that's definition, but it's not you. It's just... but our true self can be a shadow. How can I be? Will jail your body, your mind. 

So your mind is... if you can... that is the tool to adjust. You can see that, so it's coming, going. I have done presentation. Okay, I think I know myself and I live in peace. Okay. So one day I met the test and I found something different from... Yeah.
So should I dig to find the reason for the difference and have some change? The thing is: How to accept yourself? Do you feel you need to change in order to feel...? 

I don't know. Okay, when I met the test, I always find something different, but I'm thinking... So okay, I was thinking: do I need to change or adjust? Then I will be better or not? I don't know, right? 

So if I don't think... that's why the play is good like you don't say "I have to adjust." That's... I don't have... Yeah, you don't. So, it's like... Are you a doctor?

So that identity is always changing, can be always changing. Yes. But the only question is: Am I really pleased with who I am? There is something I want to be, but do I need to want it? I have it just... I don't know. I have... so I have to want it forever? 

But the only thing is because you don't have a spirit about your... So just when you are... since you are good, take basically how you are. Your parents only... maybe if you see... maybe you can see that in your heart is what you just expect from your society. 

I have tried to find a problem. It will make me... I mean uncomfortable. Yes. And a few days after, a few hours or few days, I will just let go.

Yeah. Just let go. But when you continue to see the sign, that means you have to change. If it's just one time, maybe you just let it pass. But if I continue to see the sign each time the signals get stronger, I always take notice. Okay, at least I listen. 

So if the signs continue, start to confidently follow them. Don't worry, don't say no. Just say what you want to change. If you feel silence and you're a generator, you will feel more energetic. That means you're on the right track. But if you feel more emotional, it's like where you start to get... You've got a lot of strategic decisions who cared about others.

But even if they are very important people, say "I've got more to do" so that you can focus on yourself. Raise your frequency so anybody else can benefit too. 

The projector is easy to lose energy because the projector, near the mind, doesn't have energy. Yeah, so you need to work together with a generator. If you don't, you'll live alone. If you don't have a generator spouse or kids or parents, you come to the coffee shop, you've got 70% generators around you, you can borrow the energy. So you can... Yeah, you just... they just come into your empty space.
But if you don't have your charger, like when you go home... So projector, never wait until you're tired to sleep. You need to sleep before you get too exhausted because when you're exhausted... 

You mean a countdown? Yeah. You have to have the sleeping state. Yeah. So like 1 hour before you turn down - don't wait until... Generally, generators can be like a dog: the next day, "Hey, I can..." right? But for other low energy types, you need to preserve that energy. You don't want to drain all your battery, otherwise you'll only charge partially.

You mean like to turn off the energy? No, we just quiet down one hour before you sleep. You don't want to do exercise right before sleep. But generally, generators need to be exhausted. If we don't get restorative sleep, that extra energy will damage your organs. 

So generally, you don't need to do as much as possible when you're really tired to sleep. Don't force yourself - "Hey everybody, it's close to bedtime, time to sleep." If you force yourself to sleep but you have tons of energy still, your body needs to get that energy out, and that energy will be shooting all over, so you feel so tired. So "I sleep more, I'm more tired" - that's because your old energy didn't release and your new energy couldn't recharge.

Yeah. So the battery recharges best when it's fresh. So the generator, manifestor, reflector - you need to see...

Before anybody leaves, does anyone want to give me a few minutes? I don't know, you guys, I'm very interested. So if you want me to analyze your design chart, I can just say what I see. Not necessarily that's who you are. I see. I understand. 

I constantly... Yeah. Some kind of... You two talk about... Okay, this kind of talk and... I just feel that there's a frequency, and when I feel sad I will remind myself "Hey, it's not real." Then I will remind myself that I need to raise up my frequency.
You are generator too? Yes, so it seems that it really brings good luck, I don't know. Yeah. 

Um, before, I was very easy to suffer from lots of stress and couldn't fall asleep easily. But when I let go, when I keep contact with this kind of concept, I can fall asleep very easily. Yeah. 

I don't know why... You have all the roots? Yes. So looks like you have like no color in your root center. What color root is this? What color did you have? Yes. No color. No color root. Yeah. What kind? Yeah. So that's a stress point for you.

Stress. Other people's stress getting to you very easily. No color means you don't have your own energy flow in that center. But if you're empty like this, other people's energy comes into yours. Yeah. I have color in my root center. 

So if you have an open root center, that means your stress center is like some energy in, someone else's out, 24 hours. You cannot have a break. So you need to physically rule yourself - find a quiet environment a little, then you just calm down, listen to music, do something you love. 

So blue color means the center is defined, like yourself having a defined energy. If you don't have color, that means other people can influence you very easily. Even animals - because animals and even rocks have a frequency, so someone can use a rock to heal through frequency vibration. 

Yeah, it means the more color you have... You are going to open places because you don't... So more color means you have more consistency. So you will take it for granted sometimes, you don't really realize what you have. But those open centers - just for reference - doing this today...
I couldn't do it before, so you have more of a breakthrough, right? So it's not good or bad, it's just a different way. You will find it funny. 

So what is my strength and weakness? So you are emotionally defined. Your generator type is defined by emotion. Emotions. So emotions... that means 50% of the population has emotional definition. So if you are emotionally defined, that defines who you are. Anybody who has this color knows. So you just... Let me... Everybody knows how to do it. 

So you've got both pressure centers. You've got two pressure centers - the top and the base.

Mm-hmm. So this is the inspiration from the solar system, right? This is from people. You keep stress also. If you've got two stress centers, you have to definitely pace yourself, otherwise you will feel so tight because you've got inflammation constantly downloading. Then you don't have any way to deal with it, so the pressure will come down here. Then you have energy pressure from the base, so there's a lot of stress in your body, meaning up and down. The relationship with people will be a...
relationship with yourself. You were self-critical, so you always feel something you would say "Oh, no good. I think I should do this." And when somebody's stressful energy comes in, you think "Oh, I need to help them. I can help them," right? 

But you just don't need to take that on. You can regenerate all your energy, but when you spend energy on something you shouldn't, you won't feel satisfied - you feel frustrated. So that is why you say "I am frustrated all the time." 

When you're stressed all the time, you look at your empty centers. You shouldn't have any idea or stress there. When the center is open, that means you were totally receptive like this, but you feel something there.
But that is not yours. Then you can let it go. So it will be much faster to recognize that is not yours. It would be much easier to save your energy rather than depending on someone to tell you "do this, do that." 

You can just every day say "I shouldn't have any emotion in this center if it's open. Yeah, I should feel like everything is okay." And this center, if that is open, that means you have to remind yourself "I'm enough. I don't need something else." Because when we have open centers, we become susceptible to outside influence.
Because that's related to survival. So if you have an open center and you live with a mother who has that center defined, then you feel like "I cannot live without my mother. I have to be around her" because together you feel more protected. 

But if you separate from that person, that's called separation anxiety. Right? The kids crying, the kid going "No, don't go!" That's because they don't feel that grounded mother's splenic center around them. They feel empty. They feel unfamiliar because during pregnancy for so many months they already felt what they wanted, but that's not theirs. It's just borrowed energy.

So I mean, different colors... Yeah. In the teaching, yes. But it doesn't matter. You just see the white and the color - that's defined. Mm-hmm. The white represents undefined colors. 

Then if you want to get more into how they define the channel gates, so this defines this, this defines that... So this is the whole system. Not necessarily interesting for everyone, but for me, when I coach people, it's like you need to know your energy type, you need to know your strategy, and you need to know when you're not yourself, which appears as frustration.
