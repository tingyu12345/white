### Live YOUR Life! 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqWlRJCKsjg&t=17s


Hello guys! So this is obviously a little bit different on the video than we usually do, and this is not considered our weekly Sunday video. Yes, don't worry, this is just a little bit of an extra one. So usually we don't do stuff like this, but this is something... 

If you have been watching our channel for a while, you'll know that Q1, I have made this video I think it was a year ago about the social pressure. Yeah, about, you know, kind of speaking out against social pressure and expectations from people around you, and just kind of doing what makes you feel like you're living your life in a fulfilling way. It's your life, it's your choice basically. 

So if you're interested, you can click on that up in the corner where we put it. Anyway, we were actually contacted by SK-II. I love the campaigns that they brought out with. They contacted us about this kind of new campaign that they have out about expiry dates. So basically the whole idea is, you know, "I don't expire, my age is not an expiry date." 

If you haven't seen the video yet, we'll leave the link in the description box. But basically it shows how women are really pressured to get married at an early age, and the campaign basically encourages not only women but, you know, men as well to kind of look past all this social pressure and just kind of choose what's right for you in your life. 

Sorry for... don't mind our cat. Keep it a little bit loud, but... So anyway, yes, we decided to do this campaign together, yes, about "no one ever expires." So age is not a limit. What I want to say to young people - not even just for you, even for old people - yeah, just don't limit yourself.

Yeah, for those of you who watched our videos for a long time probably know about my mom. That she's pushing almost 60, right? But she is studying for PhD. She has her own career. She doesn't want to just retire even though her friends are kind of pressuring her socially and saying "you should just stay home and rest," right?

Right. She has her own passion, and I think she's the best role model for young people.

Yeah, yeah, because she never gives up what she desires. I still really believe that even in today's society there is kind of this unconscious expectation that everyone has to meet the same milestones in life, right? And everyone has to have them completed like in a certain time frame.

Mm-hmm, so I'm just gonna pull up this example from SK-II's campaign last year. It's not even necessary for me to do this, but I just love this video so much. Last year they did this campaign on "leftover women" in China. 

And if you don't know what a "leftover woman" is, it's basically a kind of unkind term to call a woman in China who is over 25 years old and still not married. It's kind of like after that point, women are less valuable and less desirable and then just expired. And they're just... yeah that's it, that's it for you - which is just crazy! ridiculous!

Even in Korea, I've heard about this term "chasse," saying that women are like Christmas cake. Right? So on 24th, 25th are the peak, yeah, after 25 they're basically just expired, no longer valuable.

But to be fair, I think that Korea is definitely changing quickly. All right? Yeah, because the average marriage age of Korean women is actually like 30. Mm-hmm, closer to 30, early 30s. So even though there is a lot of pressure there from the older generations, I think that the younger generations are just kind of taking their lives into their own hands more and not really crumbling under that pressure.

So starting out, we use examples of, you know, just in general what this campaign is about and about Kyuho's mom. She's like defying the stereotype there. But in our case, we really took our time to get to know each other before getting married. Like we've been together since 2011, we lived together for a while, we really got to know each other before we made that decision, right?

Actually, whenever I go meet my relatives on big holidays in Korea, sometimes they'll ask how old is Sara, right? Yeah, and when I say she's two years older than me, then all of them are like, "She's pushing 30! Like you have to get married! Oh, you have to get ready for the baby too!" Right? They will always tell me that there are things that I have to do before we hit 30. 

Right, exactly. Yeah, and it's not even... the campaign does focus on women, but when you do watch some of the video campaigns they've been showing in Korea with this message, they use like both men and women's examples of, you know, certain places that they feel pressured. And for guys, I think a lot of it is, you know, you should be having, you know, you should be working in a big company and have a stable job, a real job.


So you have to be like the family provider, the breadwinner, and at least by the time you're in your late twenties. It's like... and that's really unfair pressure for guys as well, but not exactly an easy thing to accomplish in our generation and the society.

But going back to the, you know, the age thing, I think a lot of this whole expiry date, especially with women anyway, has to do with babies. And I understand that obviously as women get older there are, you know, more risks and complications in childbirth, which is true. But this is not the Middle Ages. 

I mean, there's women in their 30s and 40s having babies all the time with our advanced technology and all this pre and postnatal care that we can take advantage of today. It is not like giving birth at the age of 39 in like 1500s. It's just not the same thing, right?

So I feel like, you know, when people ask that, it's only viewing women as like a walking womb, which is, you know, it's quite crude to say it that way, but that's really what it feels like. A woman's worth is basically how many babies can you have and like how many children can you produce in your lifetime while you're still young. Like there's no, there's no other value that could be more important than that.

Yeah, I mean being a mother is the toughest and sometimes the most thankless job, and I have so much respect for women who are able to just like make that decision and go for it. Yes, but not all women choose that path, and they find, you know, other passions that give their lives meanings, and that's okay to choose that.

And vice versa, I'm also... men can support the family if women can make more money, right? Or if the woman has maybe, you know, her own desire and job, any man can be staying at home and helping the family. Exactly. Like just giving one person whole pressure is unfair, and I want you to break that schema by just watching this video and continuing on.

To, you know, life choices and the baby topic again, we have made it very clear in a few of our videos that we don't want children. It's just personally not for us. And we still get a lot of questions and that social pressure that, you know, what do you mean like you have to, and you're getting older, and it's a must.


Yeah, it's mandatory, you can't not. As a woman, if someone asks you when you're gonna have a baby, not if you want one, when... because it's always when. They just assume, and you say, "Oh, like, actually, I know we don't, we don't want children." And they'll say, "Oh, you're still young, you can change your mind." 

So I'm old enough to say I want a baby, but I'm not old enough to say I don't want a baby?

Oh yeah, I've never thought about that.

I know, it's just ridiculous, and I've gotten it so many times. It's so disrespectful to completely invalidate someone's decision, right?

And also, when it comes to social pressure, I know a lot of, especially probably most of Asian countries feel the same, that men should always have stable jobs. And I'm sure many of young people who are watching this video probably feel the same, that they get the pressure from their parents, right?

And I had to go through it too. When I was graduating from my university, my parents would tell me that you should have a job, stable job, that you're working office, 9:00 to 5:00, especially big companies. They prefer big companies.

But for some people, yes, I mean, they can maybe feel comfortable working in the office nine to five or nine to six or more. But for some people, **they have totally different desires.** They want to just divide their own time and spend on different things, or maybe they just get too bored in office.

Yeah, everyone's different. I feel like if you're, if you're really passionate about something and you work in a company in that setting, you know, you're gonna **feel very fulfilled.** Mm-hmm. But if you're a kind of different personality type and you have to be focusing on a few different things at a different time to feel, you know, **stimulated**, that's, that's fine too.

Yeah, so I know **it's always the problems** for young generations, but specifically I want to tell to those young people's parents - so if you're watching, please share this video with your parents because we will take all the blame.

I know it's hard to bring this kind of topic with your parents, but I know many older generations usually have this mindset of like "always have to have stable jobs", right? But because that's all they kind of knew in their time, so anything else is kind of scary and unfamiliar. Yeah, I understand their perspective too.


But these days there's no such thing as stable jobs, I feel like.

Very true.

Just for example, my friends make music, other friend, he builds, actually does modeling thing, 3D modeling, 3D mom... they're all freelancers. We call it real job, it's a job.

Yeah, it's not a fashion.

Yeah, they actually make money out of it. It's something different from office work, but they still do have their own passion and they learn skills. So I think it is important to support the children, and also it is important to see what your children really like and what he or she can really do.

Yeah, I mean for us personally, you know, you guys have seen our videos, we live rather modestly but we're okay with that because we both worked in companies full time. We both didn't like it. It didn't suit us. We had to try. We didn't like it.

So we thought, you know, why don't we kind of take this leap of faith and see if we can, you know, freelance, do freelance jobs half of the time, and the other kind of half the time we can, you know, do YouTube? Hopefully, I mean, this is what we'd love to do. We would rather make, you know, a little less money and love what we do every day than to go to our companies every day and come home like exhausted and just collapse.

If it weren't for you guys and everyone who's been watching over the past like, you know, two-plus years, we wouldn't have been able to follow our dream. So yeah, I don't know. I guess that's just what we're really passionate about, this kind of topic.

Just kind of, if you think that something could make you really happy if you just took the chance and tried it, do it. Because I think, I know it sounds like really corny and cliché, though I think you would regret it more if you didn't do it.

Yes, so don't limit yourself. No expiry date, there's no expiry date.

All right guys, next video is gonna be about Busan, we have, you know, on Sunday. Bye bye you!
