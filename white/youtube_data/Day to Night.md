### Day to Night｜韓屋海邊小旅行紀錄

#### Hanok Balcony & Hakenjin Beach
Yay, okay, this is really good! I haven't swum in a while—oh god, so cozy. It was raining and then the sun just *popped out*. 

I'm gonna take you guys on a little mini walk around our hanok balcony (or whatever it's called). 

**Hakenjin Beach** is so beautiful! I'm so surprised the sun came out. We were worried because it was raining heavily in the morning. We want to enjoy this as much as possible before any other clouds come pulling in.

There are really cute cafes here, beautiful areas. There's no one on the beach right now because it was raining, so this is our chance to just enjoy it for ourselves.

#### Lunch Time
It started to rain, so we saw the beach at the absolute perfect time. Now we're kind of looking for a place to eat for lunch. 

I don't know if there's a thing with sundubu here, but there are so many suitable restaurants. I love this—East Coast is famous for seafood, obviously. 

Unfortunately, Sarah doesn't like seafood, but I like grilled fish. Maybe grill fish restaurants? Fine, the owners are really good at—you know—okay, this is really good. It's very rich tasting. I like thick soup over watery. You're very specific, you're Korean guys. 

That view! Look at this, and there's a lake. Oh my gosh, oh my god, I'm definitely gonna do that. Oh yeah, this is really nice. Oh wow, this view is just spectacular. 

They left us these little snacks. I love these kind of rice snacks so much. Wow, wow.

#### Afternoon & BTS Bus Stop
After chilling at the hotel for a little bit, it finally stopped raining, so we're gonna try to get out and enjoy ourselves. 

We're going to this cute little bus stop by the ocean that's quite famous. Even though we're not very knowledgeable about K-pop, it's famous because this picture is on BTS's album (one of them or something like that). That's what we read, but it's really pretty and cute, so it's in the area we're going to tonight. 

We thought we'd pop by—it's called BTS Bus Stop (actually called BTS Busto). This beach is called Jumunjin Beach. Over there, there's a bus stop. We're waiting—that's the BTS bus stop. 

It's pretty *chilly up* there this evening, which is why there's probably no one outside.

#### Dinner & Night Swim
This is no joke—hands down the best! We're on our way to eat dinner. Since we had a seafood-based thing for lunch, we're gonna grill some meat tonight. This local place that Kew found—cause you ate like three fish, like whole fish. Nice!

The lighthouse light is right over your head behind you. Wow, I've been zooming all over the place today. Traveling is lovely but at the same time it can be a little bit tiring—fun exhausted, but damn, I need like a 10 hour sleep.

Oh my god, that was such a good meal! We had pork kalbi (pork ribs), really delicious, nicely marinated. 

A little later, we're gonna go swimming—yes, yes, a little late night swim. I haven't swum in like two years, almost same. Usually the swimming time ends at 10 p.m. here, but they're gonna give us 30 minutes by ourselves to swim and film a little bit, because we don't want to make people uncomfortable filming in the pool. 

They were very generous to let us have 30 minutes of freedom to film ourselves being just idiots in the pool without making anyone else feel uncomfortable. That's awesome! They have indoor swimming pool and outdoor streams. The infinity pool is gonna be a little too cold for me right now, but I still want to go out and see the ocean.

#### Late Night & Next Morning
All right, go ahead, I'm ready, I'm ready. Well, let's jump in! It is a lot tighter than when I last wore it. 

Hey, that was so rejuvenating! We're just gonna chill here for a little bit. This guy's gonna have a beer, we might have a couple snacks. Which one—nacho? All right, I want this one. Okay.

We're super tired, so we're just gonna eat some snacks and go to bed. Guys, we'll see you tomorrow morning.

#### Morning & Farewell
Oh my god, oh my eyes, I can't believe how clear it is—finally sunny! I like this morning, this is the perfect place to have breakfast. The sun is shining on the ocean, it's sparkling.

Good morning guys, good morning! We had our breakfast, checked out, and then enjoyed the beach for a little before heading back to Seoul.

BMO, look at my sea glass—this is gonna be my souvenir. It's so pretty, I love the colors of it. Filling up before we head back—wow, did you see that? Wow, who's that? Oh, he's smelling your face, like are you sure it's you
