Do We Have CULTURAL DIFFERENCES
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyX_mVQFZIk



Hello, hi. This is a question that we've gotten repeatedly over the last year or so, and I think it's probably something that many people are curious about when it comes to international couples. And the question is: Do we have any cultural differences? This is actually the first time we've gone into detail on this topic on our channel and really *dedicated* a video to just this.

So, the short answer is no. Yeah, sorry to disappoint you. Each couple is different, but we personally don't have any cultural differences as a couple. But on the other hand, our cultures are very different from one another. Where I'm from, probably like all Asian culture, is very collectivistic, but where Sarah's from, it's more *independent* and self-driven, and you make decisions based on you, without *necessarily* taking into account family.

So they're very different, because I think in collectivistic cultures, if you have to make a big decision, especially when it comes to marriage or relationships, it's more of like a family "yes." We have to include the whole family to make the decision. You're making the decision based on the good of the group rather than just on your own. So I think that's quite different, because even when we were going to get married, it was a different process for each of us. Yes, it was very different, yeah.

When I was dating Sarah, like my whole family had to get involved in this. They were actually a little bit concerned about our relationship. They thought maybe our relationship wouldn't *progress* because there would be a lot of cultural differences. True, when we were first dating, right? Yes, we were kind of worried about that too. I was a little bit, 'cause I've never dated... I've never dated a Korean guy before, or just anyone from Asia. But I did know that the cultures are very, very different, and I didn't know what his *expectations* were of me. And yeah, at first I was a little bit like, "Huh, I don't know, like, should I date this guy or not?" But I thought like, "Why not? I mean, he doesn't *necessarily* represent his whole culture. Maybe we'll be *compatible*." So we decided to give it a try. Yeah, it's the same for me too, yeah. And luckily my parents also started to kind of accept and understand. My parents also started to think that, yeah, it's his life, it's his choice, he should be the one who should make the decision.

Why We Don't Have Cultural Differences
Alright, so we really don't have cultural differences between us, and we wanted to talk about some of the things that may explain why we don't. And it probably has a lot to do with you and how you grew up.

Yeah, I grew up in many different countries. Sometimes I even ask myself, like, "Who am I?" because I don't know. I learned all different kinds of cultures. I feel like sometimes I don't belong in any one specific culture. Culture is a very broad topic; it's hard to define what it is. At first I thought we would have cultural differences, but I think we both did, yeah. But I started to find out that I actually have a cultural difference with my parents. That was the real cultural difference. We were just having totally different mindsets, like the way of thinking, the way of making decisions.

I grew up in India and American Embassy school, so I got all these American education. Most of my friends were Europeans and obviously Koreans. And I guess that's how I had *exposure* to different cultures. And at that time, when you're a high school student and you're a teenager, it's a really *impressionable* time when you're developing your personality, yeah. So like whatever education I learned from school, I come home, and that's where I see the cultural difference, right? With your parents, yeah. Like in American education, they will teach certain things, like about more of focusing on you. But when I come home, it's more about like the collectivistic, like family, yeah, family unit. I always have to discuss about the decision that I make. But at the same time, I was a teenager, I was growing up, so I thought like, you know, maybe that's normal. But then now I started to kind of realize like, "Oh, maybe that was the cultural difference," right?

And since Korea has developed so fast within like 70 years right after the war, and we have very unique generation gaps. It really is, obviously, between like parents and children there is a gap there, and you really have differing opinions and mindsets on things. But in Korea, this particular generation gap between like our generation and your parents is huge. It's really, really noticeable. This generation, like my generation, are more exposed to different culture, I would say, because we have technology. Yeah, they have more access to different things that we can never experience in Korea. And I'm sure back then at that time there weren't so many foreigners living and working in Korea at that time either, so it was very unfamiliar. So that's why I guess like I have more... I don't know if I can put cultural difference or personal difference, but there is definitely difference between my parents than with Sarah. So it's kind of funny, yeah, it is.

Bridging the Gap and Mutual Respect
So even though my parents were skeptical about the relationship between Sarah and I at first—at first, yes—after the marriage, they just totally like opened their mindset, and even my grandfather. Yeah, I never expected that in a million years, actually, 'cause your grandfather's, you know, he's in his 80s and he lives in a smaller village. He's never lived in like Seoul or a big city, and obviously he doesn't have a lot of contact with foreigners from other countries, and I thought there's no way he's ever truly going to be okay with this. Now he just loves Sarah. I love him. He's so kind.

Probably because like for Koreans there is hierarchy and sometimes it is very hard to approach elders. It's very hard to explain, but even I have sometimes, like with my grandfather, even though we get along pretty well, I'm aware of the hierarchy system in my culture. It's considered really friendly and polite to strike up a conversation with an older person. And I'm curious about your grandpa, so I'll just like ask him random questions. "Oh, like did you grow that corn?" "And what did you eat today?" "Oh, wow, like you can drink soju in the morning? Why not?" I would if when I'm old, I would want people to ask me questions and like pay attention to me. Maybe because I just grew up that way, not having that barrier. I'm more comfortable just initiating that conversation, even though my Korean is not great. Maybe that's what he also felt, warmth, and he opened up his mind. He asked me several questions about Canada too, and he was curious about it, about the Canadian culture, like Western culture.

Even my parents and basically our whole family started to even speak English. Like they don't expect Sarah just to speak full Korean. We are trying to find the balance, right? Balance, right. They're very reasonable about it. I mean, yes, I'm in Korea and I'm married to a Korean man, but I'm still a Canadian person, and they don't expect me to give up everything about my own culture just because I happen to be located here. I try to speak to them in Korean as much as I can, and if we get stuck, they really make the effort to try to throw a few English words in there, so we're constantly meeting each other halfway. I would never expect them to only speak English to me, and they don't expect me to only speak Korean to them, especially when we're stuck, and everyone is like fine with kind of mixing it.

Yeah, I think it's kind of unfair to expect someone only to *adapt* to my culture, like only one person. Yeah, one person, because then you're not respecting the other person's culture. I think the most important thing is the balance. You can't expect one person to completely give way, yeah, to the other person's culture and kind of like lose their identity in the process. Yeah, then like that's not Sarah anymore, right? I married her because like I love the way she is. Obviously we sometimes we have to *compromise* some small things, but it doesn't mean like we both have to give up our own culture. If we were living in Canada, I would never expect you to like, "Hey, you need to act more Canadian, you need to... you're in Canada, so like, come on, like act that way." My parents know, they know that you grew up in a different country, no one ever expects that of you, 'cause that's who you are. So I think the importance is like meeting each other halfway and respecting each other.

The Definition of a Multicultural Family
In our opinion, I think that's the definition of a multicultural family. Yeah, no one really just kind of gives up everything and assimilates completely, but there's just a healthy mix in there. And sometimes it can cause like funny moments and awkwardness, but that's part of the fun, basically.

So to summarize all of that, no, we do not have a cultural difference between us, but I have with my parents. Yeah, yeah. When people look at a couple like us, they might automatically think, "Oh wow, like that must be challenging." It's completely different for each individual. I think that both of us are very compatible in our personality, so that it's not really an issue. I've actually had a couple friends who said, "Oh, I don't know if I could ever date someone from a culture so different. I'm scared it wouldn't work out." That person is not just their culture, it's an individual, and you never know. You might get along wonderfully, and it might be too different, but you don't know until you give it a shot. So yeah, don't rule it out, give it a try.

A Special Thank You
Let's cut that. Oh yes, we just noticed the other day that some very lovely people submitted subtitles for some of our videos, like Arabic ones, Spanish ones, and English ones. And I think we're a little bit slow finding out because we... we know how it works, the submitting subtitles thing. So, and we couldn't find the usernames, so we wanted to personally thank you guys for that much. It really takes time. That's like the bane of your existence, it's to be great sometimes. Yeah, it takes time. I mean, but we really, really appreciate, yeah. Thank you to the people who did that. We really appreciate, and sorry if we were slow acknowledging that. We just, we just figured it out the other day, so yeah. Thank you so much for watching.
