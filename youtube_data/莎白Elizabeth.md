## Elizabeth 開場

Your english sucks! Hi I'm Elizabeth. So a lot of people have been asking us: "Hey Elizabeth, what language do you and Eric speak when you guys are at home?" And if you would ask me this question about five months ago, I would have said we only speak Chinese at home. But because we've just had a baby girl, so we've decided that we want to *incorporate* English into our daily life. So we've been making such a huge *effort* to bring more English into our home for her, so that when we go back to the States she can speak to her grandparents, or you know, she doesn't have to go to cram school. So that begs the question: how good is Eric's English? Can he actually speak English *fluently*? Let's ask him and find out.

## Eric 的英語學習經歷

What's up everyone, it's Eric. Today I want to talk about how I learn English, the things that I went through, and what my thought process was. As you can see, I'm in the middle of the rice fields and the farms and everything. To give you a bit of my *background*: as a person who grew up in the countryside of Taiwan, you barely ever come across anybody who doesn't speak Mandarin. To a lot of us, learning English was just something that we had to do for school exams. It was not like a language, it was not something that we know that we can use for *communicate*ions. So what's the point of learning something if we can't actually use it? So today I'm making this video to share the things I wish I would have known, and I hope it can help you too.

## 大學時期的挑戰

So it wasn't until the first year of college - as an English major, oral conversation is a *mandatory* course. Back then it was mentally *challenging* and I did not enjoy speaking English at all. Reasons being: I was too afraid I would make a lot of mistakes such as use the wrong grammar, use the wrong words, or maybe the listener won't be able to understand what I'm saying. If you can relate to what I'm saying, our *mindset* will have to change.

## Elizabeth 對 Eric 英語的看法

**Elizabeth:** So how do you think my English was when we first met?

**Eric:** Your English? I don't think I ever thought about it actually. I mean when we first met you just spoke English. I didn't even think about it if it was good or bad, I just thought "Oh, he speaks English." So that was like a surprise.

**Elizabeth:** Oh he speaks English? No, it wasn't surprising but it was just like... I mean I think a lot of people in Taiwan worry about like "Oh is my English good? Is my English bad? Like how's my English?"

**Eric:** Yeah, but I mean to be honest, I don't think we think about that because... I think anyone really cares if your English is good or bad as long as you can *communicate*.

**Elizabeth:** Yeah that's true.

## Eric 的自我意識

**Eric:** When we first met I was really self-conscious about my English, really! Especially when your Mandarin is that good. What I... because I knew I was making mistakes. I don't know if you noticed, I just thought "Okay I gotta stop making these mistakes."

**Elizabeth:** Honestly I didn't even notice. All I just cared about is whether or not we were able to understand each other.

**Eric:** Wow, okay.

**Elizabeth:** I think that that's true for a lot of Americans. We know that if English is not your first language, that's okay. Like a lot of people know that "Okay you're not speaking perfect English," but that's okay because I can still understand what you're saying and you can understand what I'm saying. That's the most important part I think.

**Eric:** Gotcha.

## 使用複雜詞彙的問題

**Elizabeth:** What do you think about the way I spoke English? Honestly when I first met you, the one thing that I really do remember is that you used a lot of really really big words and it'd be like "Why? It's not necessary to speak like that." Like I'm not your professor, I'm not like grading you. Like Americans when we speak - or native speakers, native English speakers - they speak very simply, clearly and concisely. We want to say as much as possible in the fastest and most clear way possible. We don't want to spend a lot of time using big words. Even though yeah, maybe that word like is really suitable for the situation, but we like to use very simple language. And you used to do this so much - you'd add in these big really *extravagant* words and it's like "Okay that's not necessary, native speakers don't speak like that." So I think that's what really *differentiates* the native speaker from a non-native speaker is that it sounds kind of textbook English.

**Eric:** But the problem is going through school for all these years and those are the words that you learn from the book, right? Because you don't... in Taiwan you don't actually have *interaction*s or like *personal relationship*s with foreigners when you are at a young age unless your family travels a lot or knows people.

**Elizabeth:** Right, right, right, yeah. But I think honestly, I think we really don't... don't worry so much about speaking the perfect word. More so it's just like saying what you want to say, right? You're meaning out. And I think yeah...

**Eric:** And I think a lot of it has to do with the way that we speak Mandarin.

**Elizabeth:** Uh-huh, that's right, that's right, yeah. And I think sometimes we try to translate from Mandarin to English.

**Eric:** Right, right. And using those words somehow fits in that situation but to a native speaker it just don't fit, right? Like Chinese, they use a lot of very flowery language or like very specific terms that we don't actually use in English or we don't even think about. I mean we know the word - if we hear you say, we're going to understand the meaning - but we would never speak like that, right?

## 建立自信的重要性

**Elizabeth:** So I think the conclusion that we can draw from this is: be *confident*! Yeah, yeah. Speak whatever you want to say and don't worry so much about "Is my English good? Is it bad?" Just worry about if the person you're speaking to can understand you. That's all that matters really.

**Eric:** Yeah, yeah. And I mean honestly, I don't think people are really like... if you speak to a foreigner, I've never met a foreigner who's like "Haha your English sucks!" I've never met someone like that. I mean even like... okay even if we're really really good friends, we might say like "Oh you slipped on a word, you messed up, hahaha!" Yeah, but it's really... it's like we're laughing with each other and we would do that to native speakers as well. A perfect example is when your mom notice you make a mistake and she'll be like "Yeah Elizabeth, English is your second language!"

**Elizabeth:** Exactly, exactly! So like even my mother will like make jokes with me about this. So don't worry, like Americans are very light-hearted and playful and fun. So don't be *intimidated*, just laugh along.

## Eric 改變心態的方法

**Elizabeth:** Okay so Eric, I have a question for you. Okay? What did you do to change your *mindset* that helped you be more comfortable to speak English?

**Eric:** So basically I think what I did was I tried to find as many *opportunity*es that allow me to speak English. Such as I signed up for an event held by TOEIC. I was there helping foreigners who's in the *competition* with my broken English. At the time I was really nervous, but whatever it was, I did it. And I found I learned a lot through actually using English. So I think that's what changed my *mindset* because I feel a sense of *achievement* when I started to use those words.

**Elizabeth:** So basically you just really pushed yourself to get into English-speaking *environment*s?

**Eric:** Right, yes.

## Eric 的三個英語學習建議

**Elizabeth:** Okay okay, so I have another question for you. Yes? If you want to give three tips to someone learning English, what are the tips that you give them?

**Eric:** I think of course the first one will be listening. Okay? I remember when I was middle school I had to go for a listening exam and I totally freaked out.

**Elizabeth:** So how can people listen more?

**Eric:** I think there are a lot of online *platform*s that you can use, such as... such as YouTube. Okay? Just find whatever you're interested in. I... I was listening to a lot of podcasts when I work out, or when you're driving you can listen to any type of stuff as long as you're interested.

**Elizabeth:** Okay so the first one: listen more. Yeah? The second one?

**Eric:** Second one, I think it's you have to... uh... learn to think in English.

**Elizabeth:** Okay, yeah we have to do the same learning when I was learning Chinese. I have... yeah.

**Eric:** So because what happens is when you try to translate from your mother language, sometimes it causes confusion, right? It ends up being not natural then.

**Elizabeth:** Yes, yeah, okay. And the more that you do, the more your brain will start to develop a new way of thinking. So that's my number two. Okay, how about number three then?

**Eric:** Number three is try to find an *environment*.

**Elizabeth:** Oh that's important, yeah. But okay so... say that. But in Taiwan, how do you find an English *environment*?

**Eric:** So for me what I did was I switched my phone into English. Okay? And then whatever I listen to on YouTube is English. But how about for people who want to practice their speaking? What can they do?

**Elizabeth:** Um... try to find English-speaking friends whether it's on the Internet or in person. I think there's a very good *platform* that I've been using personally.

**Eric:** Okay, it's called campaign... Cambly.

**Elizabeth:** Yes! Okay, I think I've heard of that. It's a English speaking... there's like English tutors, right?

**Eric:** Yes, from all English-speaking countries.

**Elizabeth:** Okay, I actually used that before I met you.

**Eric:** Really? Because I... I was like "I really wanted to practice but I don't know anybody that speaks English at that time."

**Elizabeth:** Okay so you get on the website and what do you do?

**Eric:** No just kidding man, I want to practice my English. For me I think the key is... one of the main keys is... um... listening. Because babies learn to speak by listening. That's how babies are taught. I have a friend from Jordan. That's why I picked up a little bit of the greetings and... yeah.

**Elizabeth:** Well that's... that's good. Your *pronunciation* was... was good.

**Eric:** Yeah apparently you weren't expecting it.

**Elizabeth:** No because I saw you were from... from Taiwan. Yeah I was like "No!" But it was a pleasant surprise. Yeah, yeah. Can you help me confirm if it's true that beggars over there makes more than what we make here in Taiwan?

**Eric:** Uh that is false because begging... begging is not allowed in the country.

**Elizabeth:** Really? There are no better... there are no beggars?

**Eric:** Yeah.
