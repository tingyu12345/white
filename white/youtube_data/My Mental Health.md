### My Mental Health & Anxiety Journey Over 30 Years In Slow American English!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrcZbllBWbg&t=389s


Hi everyone, welcome to a new episode of Bo's Slow English. In today's episode, I am going to introduce a different type or style of vlogging which doesn't require a lot of editing. I actually did some research, it's more of an old-school style of vlogging where there aren't too many edits and it's more raw content. I'm trying this method because, number one, I work a full-time job, so it's hard for me to film content and then have to edit it for you, and it takes me too long to get the video out for my viewers. Also, I feel like this way of vlogging will be more **authentic** anyway.

Today I want to talk about mental health and anxiety. It used to be a very **taboo topic**, which means **that it's not widely spoken about and if you do talk about it, it's a little bit embarrassing**. But nowadays, it is more **mainstream** to talk about mental health and anxiety. For those of you who don't know what anxiety is, and I'm not a doctor, my definition is **when you don't have control over your body and mind because there's so much stress and nervousness, and it really affects your everyday life**. Sometimes it's situational, meaning something might happen and you get anxiety from that, or physiologically, meaning in your body, your body is just used to being in an anxious mode. And I was like that up until recently, actually, for a very, very long time.

I really want to know if in your country, because I have viewers from all around the world, do you openly talk about mental health and anxiety **the way that Americans do**? If you do or you don't, I would love to know. Let me know in the comments. I remember the first time I got anxiety, I think was sometime around 7th grade, so let's see how old was I in 7th grade? Maybe 11 to 13 years old, so pretty young. I **specifically** remember one moment where I was playing soccer and I wasn't doing so well. For some reason, **during that time in my life**, I was really nervous about everything. Previous to being in the seventh grade, I think I started soccer in fifth grade, so around fifth grade, I was more confident in myself and when I did play soccer, I did really well because I didn't have fear in the forefront of my mind and I could just continue my activities and be joyful.

Then 7th grade came along and I was on the soccer field, and I remember I think I didn't pass the ball well, I forget exactly what happened, but it was a really sad time, I think, for me to go through that. And then from that point on, I had experienced that feeling of, "Oh, like I'm always **on edge**." **On edge means to be in fight or flight mode, which is kind of a psychological term, like you're always on the lookout, like, "Oh my gosh, what's going on around me? I need to always be alert."** I guess is the best way to explain that. I think also around that time is when I started comparing myself to other people. I think that's just natural when you're young, and it doesn't matter if you're a boy or girl, but you're surrounded by peers, and personally, I'm someone who wants to do a good job. I think that from a young age, I developed a little bit of **perfectionism**, which did not help with my anxiety.

So, **as I was getting older**, I'm now 36. Let's say in my 20s, my anxiety would come and go, but I think when it would come, it was at its peak, which is not good. But also during that time in my 20s, I had resources available where I can figure out in a natural way how I can overcome anxiety. I did some research on meditation. I really got into yoga practice that way I can focus on my breathing. I started to **separate myself from people who were negative**. I just always had a strong energetic field around me that I was aware of, and I had to **cut ties with** some people who were not helping me become the better version of myself.

I actually started yoga before I could drive. In the United States, you are able to get your driver's license at age 16. So I remember going to my first yoga class with my best friend and her mom maybe when I was 14 or 15. So from then until now, I have been practicing yoga, but I was much more serious about it starting in my 20s. So much so that I started going to yoga retreats, and I went to three yoga retreats: the first one was in Costa Rica, the second one was in Peru, and then the third one was in India. All of those retreats happened around New Year time, so I was surrounded by positive people, and it was a great way to **start off** a new year. I still do yoga now, and I really appreciate that when I'm on the yoga mat, I don't think about anything else but myself and my breathing, which is very important when you have anxiety. It's really hard to be focused on your breathing, and when you breathe, you want to breathe from your diaphragm or your belly to your chest, and usually when you're anxious, it comes from here, which is not good.

So now I'm in my 30s, and I am much more confident in myself as just a human, as a woman, as an adult, and that has helped me to balance the energy in my body. I've also had a lot of big life events happen through my 20s into my mid-30s, and I've learned to take back control of my life. When anxiety takes over, you just feel so helpless. So anyway, that is my journey with anxiety and mental health. I love having therapy sessions. Is that something that your country offers? I would love to know. And I work with a psychologist. Right now, it's every other week; in the past, it was once a quarter, meaning January, February, March, I only do it one time during those 3 months, and that's not a lot. So I'm now doing it more regularly, and it gives me the space to have an outsider's professional input, I guess, because they're not supposed to give you advice, but they can...

I guess I could talk about why I like my therapist. I like my therapist because he **keeps me in check**, that is an English term which means **he will tell me the truth even if I don't want to hear it, and it helps my mental growth process to be more efficient when they put me in my place or call me out**. So yeah, I would love to know how you feel about this topic and if this is something that you deal with. I hope that you can find some resources in your country, in your city, that can help you because I know how **debilitating**, which means **it hinders you from being able to enjoy your life**, I know how debilitating it can be to experience this.

Anyway, that's it. So I was able to talk for almost 13 minutes. Again, I just wanted to try this style of vlogging which is a more old-school way of vlogging so that way I can be more authentic with you and help to also get some videos out so that you can keep learning. I hope you enjoyed this. Please don't forget to like and subscribe, and feel free to leave a comment with anything at all: feedback on this video style, feedback on your journey with mental health and anxiety if you feel comfortable. And I thank you for watching. Thank you, bye!
