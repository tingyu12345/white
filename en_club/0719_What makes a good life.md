## 引言：什麼讓我們保持健康快樂？

What keeps us *healthy* and *happy* as we go through life? If you were going to *invest* now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your *energy*? 

There was a recent *survey* of Millennials asking them what their most important life goals were, and over 80% said that a major life goal for them was to get rich, and another 50% of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous. And we're constantly told to *lean in* to work, to push harder and *achieve* more. We're given the *impression* that these are the things that we need to *go after* in order to have a good life.

## 研究的挑戰

Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them - those pictures are almost impossible to get. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20. We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downright creative. 

But what if we could watch entire lives as they *unfold* through time? What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and *healthy*? We did that.

## 哈佛成人發展研究

The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. For 75 years, we've *tracked* the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out.

Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field. But through a *combination* of luck and the *persistence* of several generations of researchers, this study has *survived*. 

About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men, and I'm the fourth director of the study.

## 研究對象

Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at


Harvard College. They all finished college during World War II, and then most went off to serve in the war. 

And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods - boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.

## 研究方法

When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed, they were given medical exams, we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They became factory workers and lawyers and brick layers and doctors, one president of the United States. Some *developed* alcoholism, a few developed schizophrenia, some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made that journey in the opposite direction.

The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that the study still continues. Every two years, our patient and *dedicated* research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives. Many of the inner city Boston men ask us: "Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting." The Harvard men never ask that question.

To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms, we get their medical records from their doctors, we draw their blood, we scan their brains, we talk to their children, we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said: "You know, it's about time."

## 研究發現

So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.

We've learned three big lessons about re-


## 第一個發現：社交連結的重要性

The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially *connected* to family, to friends, to *community* are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the *experience* of loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner, and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely. 

And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely. And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage.

## 第二個發現：關係品質比數量重要

So the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the *quality* of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health - perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.

Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could *predict* who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle-aged cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old - it was how *satisfied* they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80.

And good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported in their 80s that on the days when they had more physical pain, their moods stayed just as happy. But the people who were in unhappy relationships - on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was *magnified* by more emotional pain.

## 第三個發現：好的關係保護大腦

And the third big lesson that we learn about relationships and our health is that


good relationships don't just protect our bodies - they protect our brains. It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective. That the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can *count on* the other person in times of need - those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one - those are the people who *experience* earlier memory decline.

And those good relationships? They don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memory.

## 為什麼這個智慧難以實踐？

So this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well-being - this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationships are messy and they're *complicated*, and the hard work of tending to family and friends - that's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends.

The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to *replace* workmates with new playmates. Just like the Millennials in that recent survey, many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who *leaned into* relationships with family, with friends, with community.

## 實際建議

So what about you? Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60. What might leaning into relationships even look like? Well, the possibilities are practically endless. It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time, or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together - long walks or date nights - or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years, because those all-too-common family feuds take a


terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges.

## 結語

I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: "There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heart burnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that." 

The good life is built with good relationships.

Thank you.

## Questions

Here are the answers to your questions, based on the provided source material:

### 1️⃣ Has that video shifted your perspective in any way?（這部影片有改變你對人生的看法嗎？
Ans:
- Yes, it did give me a new perspective on what really matters in life.

Especially the speaker emphasized building good relatiionships is the key to a good life, which leads to better health and happiness.

For me, working hard and saving money was always my priorities early on, but now I see the importance of relationships

So If I want to live longer and happier, I probably should focus more on my relationships with family and friends.


### 2️⃣ Do you fully believe or agree with what Robert Waldinger said in the video? Please share your different findings if there is any.（你完全相信或同意影片中的觀點嗎？如果有不同的看法，也請分享。）
Ans:

I agree with most of what the speaker said. Having good relationships is beneficial for mental health, because I face different situations every day. Sometimes I feel stressed or anxious, and when someone is there to support me—even just staying with me and listening—it really helps and makes me feel better.

I believe that the quality of relationships is more important than the quantity. For me, some friends I have known for a long time, even though we don't meet often, every time we do, we can still talk as if we just met yesterday, and I feel comfortable with them. So I think it is more important to have a few close friends in your life.

### 3️⃣ Are you content with your current life? Anything you wanna change or improve to lead a better life?（你滿意目前的人生嗎？想改變或改善哪些事來過得更好？）
Ans:

Overall, I’m pretty happy with my life. I have a stable job, a place to live, and my family. I also have a few close friends I can count on, and I’m really grateful for that.

Most weekdays, my routine is just going to work and coming home, so my social life isn’t very active, and sometimes I get bored. I’ve been thinking about how I could make my social life better.

In 2023, I joined a yoga class because a good friend invited me. The yoga coach was super nice and patient, and every time I finished a class, I felt more relaxed and connected with others. I even made some new friends, so it was a great experience for me.

Last year, I also started going to the gym and took workout classes for six months. I wanted to get more healthy, build some muscle, and make exercise a regular habit.

Joining those workout classes was a good decision. I learned the right way to train and build muscle. Even though I didn’t gain a lot of muscle, I feel more energetic than before.


  
### 4️⃣ What brings you joy that doesn’t fade over time?（什麼事能長久帶給你快樂？）
Ans:
- For me, doing something I love, even just a little thing that brings me a little joy, I think that can help me feel happy and fulfilled. As long as I can do it constantly.

Finding things that are beneficial to people and making a positive impact in their lives.
by doing that, I feel like helping others is a way to help myself, when you help others, you also can have connections with them, and just like building positive relationships.

Take of myself, I think that’s also important. I try to eat healthy food, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. When I take care of myself, I feel better physically and mentally.
