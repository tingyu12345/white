#### The Foundation of Wise Love Choices

One of the most important principles for choosing a lover *sensibly* is not to feel in any hurry to make a choice. Being satisfied with being single is a *precondition* of satisfactory coupledom. 

We cannot choose wisely when remaining single feels *unbearable*. We have to be utterly at peace with the *prospect* of many years of *solitude* in order to have any chance of forming a good relationship - or we'll love no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us being so.

#### Society's Pressure on Singles

Unfortunately, after a certain age, society makes singlehood feel dangerously unpleasant. *Communal* life starts to *wither*. People in couples are too *threatened* by the *independence* of the single to invite them round very often, in case they're reminded of something they might have missed. 

Friendship and sex are, despite all the *gadgets*, still remarkably hard to come by. No wonder if, when someone slightly *decent* but not quite so comes along, we *cling to* them to our eventual *enormous* cost.

#### The Incomplete Sexual Liberation

When sex was only available within marriage, people recognized that this would lead some people to marry for the wrong reasons - to obtain something that was *artificially* *restricted* in society as a whole. Sexual *liberation* was intended to allow people to have a *clearer head* when choosing who they really wanted to be with.

But this process remains only half finished. Only when we can make sure that being single is as potentially as *secure*, warm and *fulfilling* as being in a couple, will we know that people are choosing to *pair up* for the right reasons.

#### The Path Forward

It's time to liberate *companionship* from the *shackles* of coupledom and make it as widely and as easily available as sexual liberators wanted sex to be. 

In the meantime, we should *strive* to make ourselves as much at peace as we can with the idea of being alone for a very long time. Only then do we stand a chance of deciding to be with someone on the basis of their own and true *merits*.
