根據錄音內容，一個合適的英文檔名可以聚焦於所討論的核心概念，即人類圖（Human Design）與能量（Energetic）的自我理解。

以下是一個建議的英文檔名：

**Human Design: Energetic Self-Understanding**

這個檔名之所以合適，主要基於以下幾點：

*   **Human Design（人類圖）**：來源中多次提及「human design system」，並將其描述為結合了四大古老系統（易經、卡巴拉、脈輪）和現代科學的能量系統。它被視為一種「GPS」，幫助人們理解自己的本質和生命路徑。
*   **Energetic（能量的）**：錄音強調一切皆是能量和頻率，包括我們的身體和周遭環境。了解自己的能量類型（如生產者、投射者等）是理解自身運作方式的關鍵。
*   **Self-Understanding（自我理解/自我認知）**：整個對話的核心在於鼓勵聽眾去了解「你是誰」、「你為何在此」，並接受真實的自己，而非社會期望或制約。透過這個系統，人們可以更好地理解自己的身體訊號、情緒反應 以及如何與自身的能量流動保持一致。

因此，「Human Design: Energetic Self-Understanding」這個檔名能清晰地傳達錄音內容的主題，即透過人類圖系統來深入理解個人的能量本質與自我。

*   ascension. But before you can achieve the ascension(提升), you have to let go. Let go your worry. Let go your money. Sometime I lost a lot of money. Let go of the attachment for somebody something. So not everybody need to go through the ascension process like I did. But eventually everybody will have a process to return to who you are like your **innocent** child. We are all becoming condition that I have to be successful, I have to be beautiful, I have to be this, this list on and on and on because we want to be accepted right but acceptance need to come from here if you don't accept yourself you just mold yourself to somebody's expectation eventually if you're empty
*   so this whole thing is just tune you to tell you what you are energetically not like what is that but read the energetic field we we have nine different center based on this system for human design system but this is not only just coming out from nowhere it's four ancient system so I send that to you guys I'm not sure later maybe you guys can and we'll see the n so this is talk about as a four system combined this energetic system it's from in each is 6 or 8 thousand years ago. Interested to find the background and the second one is the the cabala cabala. We might not know Kabala is ancient people about ascension process. We are coming down here to be a human body but we are not what we see who we are energetically. We are not what we see. So then there's process your call back to home. So that's the ancient deep. The other one is the chakra. If you practice yoga, meditation, you know, they want you to calm down to ground it, right? So that is your frequency in your body. Everything's frequency based on the 21st century science. I'm scientist. So what they mean is this is the energy certain frequency that we can see the color, right? Every cell is the light vibrate at different frequency. So we can see the differences but they are not forever in this form right before this this wood before the wood is the seeds but they are all following the same energy pattern but they are just transformed different form right so that is everything is energy that is actually the universal law the first law you need to know it's not like Newton it's not like scientific law which the universal law that means the first one is law of the frequency just I say our eyes can only see narrow spectrum of the lights the color the wavelength like we cannot see out of we can see there so it's like spectrum our eyes can see so that's frequency there but in the main something we don't see there's nothing there You can you see microwave? No.
*   Can you see radio wave? Are they there? Yeah. So right now we begin to understand we are limited. Our body our senses is always just choose to see certain range outside is there but we don't know and but our body know. See if you sensitive enough you go to a room like this quiet automatically you feel sad. But You don't have a reason to feel sad but their vibration the low vibration sadness come into your body right so you feel so energy is different form but our body can tell our mind not necessary our mind is really logical right we only say oh if I don't have a reason I shouldn't feel sad right but just feel sad you just don't have any reason so your mind will direct us to different function and judgments. So that's why we need to know our body so we can balance. Yes, my mind say you are this this but my body tell me a different story. So we have to kind of understand they are all telling the truth. That's different way to tell you the information. So the brain will tell you what's wrong, what's the problem you have to solve, what's the differences. So you feel nervous, pressure depressed because you don't know you don't feel I have a solution. So mind you lower your deep so you become worn saying make you feel okay they have to do their work they have to tell you some difference a little for purpose that's the brain but our body Your heart is connect to everything. So ants, animal, rock, everything around you is connected by energetic. So if you allow your heart to calm mind, excuse me, so we can have more seats. Faster. No, no. I mean move together to
*   so open. Yeah, open there. Nice. It's not good. No problem. No problem. But anyway, the first law is lower frequency. Understand frequency is everything. in African totally up to earth but how I study a lot of very impressive for so in that darkness I'm searching Bible everything I learn psychology You know, I always just attend the conference and I will be happy. No one can be truly happy. So happy. Yeah. So that's because I'm in the very low because I don't feel I can be free without happiness. But one day I'm just like well which way I didn't go. Oh go find a solution. Find a home. So say why there is still outside of me. The only thing I really do is who I am, why I'm here. That question is always there. But I never had the courage to face myself, right? But this one when I finally decided I want to change my change my life. I want to learn the language of the universe. This one is supposed to come to me to use like what is this? I don't want to learn a new thing. Nothing works, right? I'm very threat. So my story is inside. I'm going to eat something here. What is in the cloud? What can I prove it? All this question and running but this is just the practice practice for us to find out we are not what we think we are until first between different colors of our body and our whole resonates certain things in our the system we have the ancient system your energy you can listen to different frequency of music and you can tune into that frequency then the science for example they put all those Tik Tok in the whole room in front of me in 10 minutes. Everybody talks when the frequency around the room they're different but eventually universe won't harmonize them.
*   When you in the environments causing you some disturbance that is not permanent. Just remember that. feel something you don't like but that doesn't say you are bad you can say I'm unhappy no you feel unhappy you are not equal to unhappy see the definition sometime we limit ourselves I'm nobody but you can see I feel because you are nobody so that that That realization can start to let you shift your mind to different people. So before you always feel this negativity, problem solving, comparison, worry, fear. But now you know that's just part of the shift. But in order to shift it, you have to know who you are, what you can do. You have to regain your confidence. You have to regain your connectivity. It's in order to flow with the law. You always against the law. Of course, you are against the train. The water going this way means so against it. How about turn around on the floor and observe everything and learn the new skill. That's how I get out myself. Show gratitude for everything I experience. The person, the event my son died. the past 27 years old. You cannot that long but he's and he's still very talkative at events. He play game with his brother. He to do that his photo eyes but he uses eyes his eyes our eyes That's why he has technology very high for people like him. You can use the light to open the door and operating spirituality. So I observe that oh it's really powerful and also the determination about I just every day we wake up to the mayor like hey there's another day to play. Even when he peaceful just looking at me like it's not just really like really one breath away about that but we didn't start life it's just one breath away and I don't have any different energy it's not gone it's just different so that lower frequency you master that because we don't know. We don't know what we don't know, right? But we don't need to j Oh, they are gone because they cannot connect us physically but energetically. Everybody's connected because you couldn't separate your energy from me, right? That's why when co hit everybody have a six. Did you feel more calm because we need a based on people. So if you like this person has open center I will talk about that as three open center that mean your other people's energy can just influence get in and get out you have no idea but you have to know yourself in the way oh I don't need to worry about it it's somebody else so you can sit there and sip your car over tea don't worry about and try to figure out what is wrong with me why I'm have this idea why I feel stress There might be somebody else maybe yours I don't know right but it's just talking about energy becoming
*   so just let it be let it grow it means don't concern yourself only don't care about others right it's don't say don't care it's like you have to have compassion about the feeling you have for yourself if that's coming from somebody they suffer and you feel they suffer so if you have compassion to yourself you have compassion to that person The energy is sharing and not doing. Yeah. But the diff is when the when the things happens the first Yeah. solve it solve it. Reaction. It's not easy to control.
*   Yeah. That's why we got problem. That's called condition. Condition is like when you are small everybody like your teacher, your parent, your sibling, they have a certain way to deal emotion. They have c We eat their food. We learn because we need to fit in, right? So we learn but not necessarily fit in with our true design. So human design systems get you to not to bring other bring you this mystery life. It's like I allow it happen. If I know myself, I don't spend more time to deal with that. I just say that's your idea. I respect that. I don't have any idea there but that's your idea. I have to think about it. So contagional boundary if you always just say yes yes yes and just a little bit like me when I was young so depressed but yes to everything I'm a good student you know and that about why I was still suffering so if you're even more angry um but if you know who you are you might have a temporary you know people don't like it you know you don't have friends but your new friend will come in because we always meet people at the same time Then you start to grow together.
*   So I learned from tip and you guys get together with you guys really to the people together and share knowledge. So today this one is really not just saying this one fix nothing can fix until we decide to be fixed. You agree that because when I was like totally angry be happy one fixing because I try everything but because I deny that first I cannot be fixed but now I know yes I cannot be fixed but I have to accept first when they say I want to fix it that mean you admit you have problems right
*   but I'm not perfect if I accept say yeah what's the h I don't like it so what now your conf start to take it over about this way of doubts. Then you just live the way you feel the most amount with yourself. Then your friend you don't like to me they'll be gone. Whatever influence your life give you a lot of pressure they will be have some reason just disappear like it's all gone. But then you have to accept and new way of opening contact. So sometimes we don't feel comfortable because we like to a lot of people stuck in the stress level because they don't know if they're better to stay in the place that we feel comfortable. But sometime in our life you really way up. Your energy field start to have a way to accept the new You can adjust it. You just like a radio when you need a low cannot hear the see. You just fine tune it into you can hear it's very clear directions. Even you cannot hear you can feel that's feel good and feel harmonizes the decision stuff like that. So this will teach you the strategies. Um then once you experience the higher vibrations you can see the world different. You see different color you sense the thing you never seen. Like you're so busy you walk by rose never look the rose always going to be but when you are higher vibration you just you can sense the little just there you just look at oh I think that is weird so you start to look the little thing about you that's indicating your higher feelings because you can sense other things and focus on So hope once you are curious about the system then read some book or go out and check it out and start to play with it. It's really experimental system. Then if you notice you start to feel more at ease and sleep better smile to people that mean you are on the right track. But you still like to stay for familiar talent which maybe not necessarily who you Maybe you judge yourself too fast. Why people can be safe? No, it's not your problem. It's really your mind is too tight. You have to let it go slowly. The other thing is everybody notice the world is changing, right? It's just so many things with past we think is common sense, not common sense. People do something we don't understand. So that's transition. We're going to a different background frequency. So when the background frequency change your mind, our behavior start to change. Before this change we are logical, very powerful everything have a system but we are transferred to a very free wide range society. So people like us very logic we will have difficulty to adapt. to that. So this system actually I call it got four different system. So the outside is the 18 right it's a 64 each one has six lines and number one to 64 and that's the Hindu chatbot system. So if you know there is a Chinese way say have you heard that before?
*   What does that mean? When I first I have no ide So far it's like so long what's the relationship but this is actually connection. So when we are moving around do our things we have to be grounded right we have to we cannot really fly yet we are stay right so we connect with the earth. So when the earth have certain feelings they coming from system and the top we have tangi Right. Every planet have a frequency in it. Why they want soft people? Because they're easy to finish. Yeah. Have you watched the movie the matrix hiker? Right.
*   No information. It's just a movie. But it's similar what we experience. This four are circle they don't move they are angle. So 64 minus the four 60 right 360. So each six will move to a different number. So when they move actually this frequency is different. So they download to our 70% of the people we all have our own health center. So we can res the information from above those we call explanation. So it's not an idea it's explanation they are in the correctness of this or that don't do this do that sometime people sensitive they can hear those actions
*   my mother did yes someone can do that right yes for a very short period of time so like we don't know so we kind of like weird how they can do that psyche or something call it but it's because of the design. Everybody designed the energetically different somebody easy to connect the voice agent sound that has like but this is not something I'm saying just for you to accept something the science couldn't explain like a lot of science can explain how can we do that That's because we all train so many years. Think about one structure. The experts said that. So other things science now you move to the different era frequency start to change. We will start have more people accept those things untouchable invisible and untouchable because those things is coming. So us very rigid in the back left brain. We need to have an adaptation process. So this is the tool for us to understand why I feel this know it's nothing wrong with not my body my mind but it's just my mind want to go back to so that is the system okay astrology 12:00 and the I ascension process is like we coming here to explore the earth but we are energetically being so we are energetically we have some connection with
*   the is part of the system that is the outside is the eating and kabala together so they give you kind of TPS like eating actually is the code for your life just like when you book a trip you go to a place called your energetic being so beautiful you go down there because the earth is much lower so you have to do that So you down in there then you have to have otherwise confused. So GPS GPS is your man they give you the pass. So when you come here maybe you like but that's not you. So don't get too attached to that identity but then you understand your identity is different whatever that you want to go.
*   It's true. How do we know that it's not you? That's why you have to feel uncomfortable. Your body will tell you. So you can trust your body. Your body feel numbs or something. It's not your don't find a doctor. Don't accept that information. What trying to say? Okay. Sometimes because my gesture is not in the right position. Yeah. So it's not about the stress because my judge doesn't have you have it to sit down.
*   cuz your brain function is to compare to but your body can tell you oh you sit the wrong way so you feel sore. thing will be different. Yeah. Particular those things the doctor cannot fix. A lot of people has a solid sympto that can be get stubborn. I said no I have problem so it's not that simple right? So I need Yeah that's the other thing is We still trust ourselves. We can feel ourselves. So when you have a problem, you can just that way. But if there just a little discomfort, that's the time to communicate to I'm not judging you. A lot of people,
*   no, I'm going to call your legs. Not good. You know why I'm this one and that one? The frequency is so under science when you meet a low frequency your body protection so they cannot hear you the only high frequency you can hear. So how to lift or raise your just detach all the don't find anything until you start to just play memories believes So if you live in the field so your body eventually start to remind you you live in the low fe you're going to have this and you still don't want them. the disease you can only use the medicine to maintain heal.
*   So when you can really heal yourself do it raise your frequency then even you need to see the doctor really heal yourself so many cases cancer patient stay what they do they go for fun and they come by because they don't worry about oh I'm going to die I have a cancer you know all the negative people and they think oh I only have like two three months to live let's have fun then you raise the people you don't worry about so that is really the physical body but this is not say this is the tool this is the tool for you to chapters getting inside. Then I list about the N center of this anticipation to tell you this because this is the nine centers from the top to the bottom and they are energy centers they actually have different functions. So if you have a posterior profile you have
*   yeah the other mean Yeah, this is the human design charts I'm talking about. That's the gen that is your GPS. But this is your body. This is our energetic body. Everybody's different. So you will have open center, you have a divine center. So in the open center, you always have more influence by others. But if you have a color in this divine center, then you are more bonded, know who you are. But that's just going back to you have to stop to explore. But this one says everything the energy the energy will decide desire your uh to determine your psychology. So this will talk about psychology too. So certain people it doesn't I don't even know you. I don't need to hear your story. I don't think it's not because I know the system. So you don't need to heal other people but as long as then you can understand of course I cannot teach today this me but eventually I will have a course to talk about psychology and your diet your diet is energy too. So you don't know your body type maybe dying the wrong timing. You can do everything to lose weight and not so this is a book I find out maybe just what I read maybe it's in English so I don't this book so I come here I read so very simple so this talk about the gates like this the connection or something what that mean how you can deal with your daily life so this is going to be a reference go to the library or You cannot do what they understand want to learn. But if I can say we come down from the tool right being decide to come we come down. We need to have a body to take on the right. So the body is like a car like we eat the car. The body is a car. So the body has a lot of perspective things car. about the who's driving the car
*   mind. Yeah. It's the ego. This ego want something, desire something, they train something. So they have their logical thinking. That's the ego's drive. Then your soul like passengers passes. You should just like hey drive over there. If that is the perfect But we don't want so we are always saying something but that's not fun on the ego. Eagle is driving. So if the passenger is not awake passing they are dreaming. They are suffering. They don't care what's outside and the ego take you to a place not because they have their own conditions. depends on culture. You have to have it through generations. So you let the ego to take but our essence is not that we should combine with our ego. We didn't plan our ego. So we are still the master. Ego is not a master. If you listen to your mind that mean you're not You let your mind but this is not everybody not exist can do it. It's just the system suggests that is the correct scenario. You are You know the sea kind of right? So you relax you feel more radiance and happy it's not because you spend the money right it can be but actually away from the you are more yourself. So when you're more re more relaxed more calm more happy and you relax yourself and different energetic tan it's a point of t generate We try to generate something called generator. Generator want to work. So we create a lot of energy for how but when generator is not working on something. So if you work on something for so long always frustrating that might not be the focus your body tell don't do this condition. I don't care. to do.
*   So you all going to do it. And the second one is called projector. If you clear your profile, you got projector. I you are generator. Producer. Producer. Yeah. So you always have a lot of energy. You want like a little in you know and the more you go far you feel more energetic. The the number that is different. Yeah. Different type of one to six. So you combination. Five and four. Yeah. Two than four. Two and four is more and six. Four and six. You're on four and six. Working hard.
*   So generator is all working hard. But if you work on the wrong thing, you feel frustrated. So if you feel satisfied, contentment is the energy worth thing. So if you choose something, okay, I want to do this. But then after doing why I'm doing this, I get frustrated. This is a lot of complaint. That's just like you shouldn't you should find a way to get out. This is not what we need to do. And sometimes things just so hard. So how to I mean sometimes things just so hard. So how is like um this this thing is is not right for me or just this thing is hard and we need to
*   so you need to take a break. If you take a break come back you still feel frustrated. It's just Yeah. just like temporary everybody has temporary stress that's fine but with prolonged time you know more than 5 years forget about it right and the second type projector the generator you generate the population 70% is generated because we need energy we need to build something so we got 20% Projector don't have any energy center this one projector vector. So center is called sec life force life force projector don't have it. So they have to borrow generators in A projector need to have a generator. That's why 70% of generators but projector they usually can see somebody's heart. So projector is the best managers. They connect to others through the heart not by But they have to take care of themselves. Sometime they so close other projector know your projector when you are feeling you you strive for success because you want everybody to be successful. That's your trait.
*   But when you are don't have a successful feeling. You just like We can do the research project but projector is the future manager because we are not but you can see like this project. I want to do this. So young focus until you got your energy know let me ask her and that is over your talent. Don't chase people I know. I know this nobody will listen to you. So this project then about 7% or 9% call man in English manifestation we all like man money but the man factor they don't so they can take initiative but they leave the work together in creative.
*   They are they initiated creative like Elon Musk they have very novel idea then the generator will make it into practice and become a product. Yeah that's right a lot of leader the past leader like just they are all manager They can be good. So we can change the world very quickly. And then the last type is called reflector. Reflector is really totally don't have any technology in the center. So their information is all coming from others. So they are very confusing. because they don't like but today I feel I'm more like Tim and tomorrow oh I like sunny so who I am so they are always separating other people's but because they are separate they were easy to see outside of the like the program is only bank of 50% so anybody follow the big feelings similar but then because projector they can feel differences like today she say her and tomorrow she can say oh different so she's know this not her because we change overnight so she become more flow with whatever and they don't need not to restrict theel
*   but the caveat to that is they don't know the direction they always to do right. But this four different being together in the perfect society will be the initiator the manufacturer said let's build the peaceful world right in then the generator say good idea let's do it right the projector say let me manage you guys do this you guys do that let me practice this say let me observe who is not doing their job. So the perfect thing is to say we're the doer with the work but not because we want and that is because we have 70% generator most of us not doing so we are all students So the project
*   they feel bitter. So every energy like many feel they are not doing their job. So they they don't like pun right they do this and people say nothing. stuff do something do so much then look at what they get they don't know what's going on they just so confused they don't they don't get what they do. This is a 12 profile and this is The um the number is just higher coordinates the different system but it's the same. So the jinky. So here is the follow suit right? It's body body grass here. So the jinky is the one the message we coming down like it's burying our system until we start. So we get into this feelings and what do one day understand green color, red color. So green color for you is That mean you finally realize, oh, I got some tool. I never know. Let's open the box to see what those things help to get out.
*   So, so that is your genius. Your your primary gift the gift and they have a three different spectrum. You see that sh then you have a gift. You have the seat. But I want to ask a very kindergarten question. How can we make a shadow? Shadow. How come make a shadow against the sun? Yeah. So you need to have objects. Object. Then the light. Light. The shadow. Yes. Right. Mhm. So this is what we are. We are together with the light. Shadow. And but we can adjust the conscious a little bit. You can stay in the shadow like 20 seconds or you can turn around and facing the light. Right?
*   So he didn't want you to study. He just want you to change your perspective directions. So if you each sphere has different three spectrum then you start and play with it. For example, I have one two something. So then when shadow is education so I feel like I need to do something couldn't you know I that's education right so but if I can make that energy become focused and I take the initiative since my house is such a mess I got this extra medicine let's clean so you turn that agitation into some kind of action. But the action could be productive or destruction or chores. I can go out and touch the tree. I can clean the house whatever I want to do with the education. But then you take initiative once you train yourself easy to flow from shadow to the positive actions. Then eventually your adjuster and the highest one is awakening. So once I train myself knowing I have this energy I can direct it the way I choose to then easy to understand oh I'm doing this awakening not doesn't mean like awaken is you the past you're going to get this and all of a sudden oh I can do that that's an awakening so don't take don't be brainwashed that I have to be Jesus have to do something sin you This can happen the way you like but you need practice. That's how you can use the all the fear all the different shadow shadows that go lower.
*   Yeah. So that's your lower frequency. So psychosis that's why you always think about too far. You always just find the reason. You want to solve the problem. So you always just you think why that happened to me? So you everybody's like that. Who is that? Think about the problem. We all think about the problem. So that is shallow didn't mean they think it's like a human behavior. We are but you can turn that worrying doubts into inspiration. So let's just have fun. Let me just inspire yourself. So your energy move up in the highest one secticity
*   sensity sensity. Yeah. That is one. So that light is always so we are So like all the things they just oh I'm this out of that but that's definition but it's not you it's just but our true self can be a shadow. How can I be will jail your body your mind. So your mind is if you can that is the tool to adjust you can see that so it's coming going I have done presentation okay I I think I know myself and uh I live in peace. Okay. Okay. So one day I met the test and I found something different from Yeah.
*   So should I should I dig to find the reason the difference and have some change? The thing is How accept yourself do you feel you need to change in order to feel I don't know okay when I met the test I I always find some different but I'm thinking so okay I was thinking do I need to change or adjust then I will be better or not I don't know right so if I don't think that's why the the play is good like you don't say I have to just That's I don't have Yeah, you don't. So, it's like Are you a doctor?
*   So that identity is always changing, can be always changing. Yes. But the only Am I really pleased with who I am? There is some I want to be but do I need to want it? I have it just I don't know. I have so I have to want it forever. But the only thing is because you don't have a spirit about your So just when you are since you are good take a basically how you are doing your parents only maybe if you see the maybe you can see that in your heart is what you just expectation for your society. I have tried to find a problem. It will make me I mean uncomfortable. Yes. And a few day after a few hours or few days I will just let go.
*   Yeah. Just let go. But yeah, but when you continue to see the sign that mean you have to change. If you just one time maybe you just say that I continue to see the sign each time the signals stronger I always got killed okay at least I listen so if you the signs continue to start to confidently don't worry don't don't say no yes just say what I change to that I want you if you feel silent more energetic generator. You will feel more energetic that means right. But if you feel more emotional just like where you start to get you got a lot of strateg president who cared about other president
*   but even they are very important people say I got more to do so that can focus on to blow yourself up and raise your feet so anybody else so the the projector is easy to lost energy because the projector near the mind doesn't have an energy yeah so you need to work together with generator. If you don't you live it alone. If you don't have a generator, spouse or kids or parents, you come to the coffee, you got 70% generator around you, you can borrow the energy. So you can Yeah, you just they just come into your empty sea.
*   But if you don't have your charger like you go home just like So projector never wait until you're tired to sleep. You need to sleep before you at least go down because when you're exhausted, you mean you mean a countdown? Yeah. You have to have the sleeping stateless. St. Yeah. So like 1 hour before you turn down like wait until we generally we can like t like a dog. The next day, hey, I can right But for for other low energy needs need to be preserve that you don't want to drain all your battery otherwise you only charge for
*   you mean like the to turn off the energy. No we just quiet down one hour before you sleep. You don't want to do exercise exercise. But generally they need to be exhausted. If we don't be resourced sleep those extra energy will damage your organ. So generally you don't need to be do as much as possible when you're really tired to sleep. So don't force yourself say hey everybody close to bedtime to sleep. You force you to sleep but you have tons of energy still we think your body needs it out and that energy will be shooting over so you feel so tired. So I sleep more tired. is because your old energy didn't release and your new energy couldn't recharge.
*   Yeah. So the the battery recharge the best way to use it charged fresh. So the generator manufacturer reflector you need to see before Anybody want to buy to give me a few minutes? I don't know you guys, but I don't even not because I very very interested. So if you want me to, you know, you have your design chart, I can just say what I see. Not necessarily that's who you are. I see. I understand. I constantly Yeah. some kind of you two talk about okay this kind of talk and um I just feel that there's a frequency and when I feel sad I will remind myself hey it's not real then I will remind myself and I need to raise up my frequency
*   you are generator too yes so it seems that it really bring good luck I don't know Yeah. Um before um I was very easy to suffer from lots of stress and couldn't cannot uh for sleep easily. But when I let go with when I keep contact with this kind of concept um I can fall asleep very easily. Yeah. I don't know why you have all the roots. Yes. So Look like you have like no color boots. What color room is this? What color did you have? Yes. No color. No color boot. Yeah. What kind? Yeah. So you that's a stress.
*   Stress. Other people's stress getting to you very easily. No color. Like the color one is that you have your own energy flow. But if you empty like this, other people come to yours. Yeah. I have color. So if you have open root center that I mean your stress center is like some in someone out some 24 hours. You cannot have a break. So you need to physically rule yourself on environment quiet a little then you just like to calm down listen to music something you love to do that. So blue color means
*   color is like yourself has a defined energy. If you don't that mean other people can influence you very easy or animal because animal even rock has a frequency so someone can use the rock to heal frequency vibration yeah it means more you have You are you are going to open places because you don't So more color means you have more color is like this is more consistent. So you you will take for granted sometime you don't really realize you have but those open w just for reference doing this today
*   I couldn't do it before so you have a more of the breakthrough right so it's not good or bad it's different way You will funny. So what is my strength and weakness? So you are emotionally defined. Your generator is defined by emotion. Emotions. So emotions sess that mean 50% of population all emotion. So if you are emotional define who you are anybody has this color. He knows color. So you just let me Everybody knows how to do. So you got both hands. You got two pressure center the top and the base.
*   Mhm. So this is the the inspiration from the solar system, right? This is from people. You keep stress also. If you got two stress center, you have definitely day yourself otherwise you will feel like so tight cuz you got inflammation keep download then you don't have any way to deal with it so the pressure will come down here then you have energy pressure from the base so there's a lot of strap in your body mean up and down the the the the uh the relationship with people will will be a
*   relationship with yourself you were self critic so you always or something you would say oh no good I think I should do this and somebody's stressful trash the stress coming oh I need to help them I can help them right but you just don't so you can regenerate all the energy but when you spend energy out of something you shouldn't you won't feel satisfied you feel frustrated. So that is the way you said I am frustrated all the time when you stress all the time that you look yours all empty. You shouldn't have any idea. You shouldn't have any stress when you open that mean you were totally like this but you feel something
*   but that is not then you can let it go. So it be much faster into Stitch that is not yours. It would be much easy to save your energy rather than depends on someone to tell you do this do that. You can just every day say I shouldn't have any emotion if that is yeah I should feel like everything is okay and this is like the center right if that is open that mean you have to remind yourself I'm enough I don't need I don't need something else because when we are open we become to associate
*   because that's related to survival. So if you're open then you live with the mother which is defined then you feel like I cannot live with my mother I have to be around because because you together you feel more protected but if you separate from your own that's called separation anxiety right the kids crying the kid going get out No, that's because they don't feel that grounded mother splint center around them. They feel empty. They feel not familiar because they pregnant so many years they already feel what they want but that's not theirs. It's just
*   so I mean different color. Yeah. In in the teaching. Yes. But it doesn't matter. You just see the white and the color that's defined. Mhm. The white is undefined colors. Then if you want to get more like how can they define out the channel gate so this define this this divine that so this is the whole system not necessarily interest but for me I coach people it's like you need to know your energy type you need to know your strategy you need to know when you're non cell which is frustration those things How to use this to adjust. Don't waste your energy to go through the process. Go through the process somehow stay.
*   So you you mean you mean people need to control your energy balance for every day? You couldn't control your energy but you have to know be aware. So you use different strategy. If you know you're going to be tired and something you Don't want to game schedule tight. Yeah. Until the last minute cuz you choose to do that. But if you know you you're not energy type need to have a breaks in between you know so you can adjust it. So your energy is always flowing right now not against you. That's why the typ just to be honest. If we don't know ourself we eat the wrong food wrong the wrong schedule. We make the wrong friends. is already against yourself. But we choose to do that because we don't know once you know and accept no you are shadow light at the same time.
*   You become to like to play. Yes. You don't feel nervous. Oh, I never know what to do. Yeah. You teach my triangle empathy. Does it mean anything special? Where? Which one you The triangle and the triangle. You have the both then the head, right? Or other divine. So are you very easy to get sick when you eat the younger younger kids in the kindergarten? You also the first one to get a job. Sorry too quick. Are you the first one to get sick with family in school? Sick. Get sick. Yeah.
*   Get sick. the first one. I don't remember. Accurate time. Accurate time. Accurate time. Yes. So you don't remember. But let me ask you this. Did you find out it's kind of difficult to let go something you collect a lot? Like even this not good thing but you Oh, I collect that was 3 years ago. I keep How about your emotion? Did you feel emotion? Uh, very stable. The first time I I take this, but I think I it didn't feel in the time.
*   like you know that is your it doesn't mean say when you you have a very strong mind. So, your mind some the opposite is like because we don't know who we are so we have our we want to be this person so anything not align with this person we don't we don't say that it's us a lot of men particularly men because you got pressure you have to be tough to so a lot of men actually they don't even know they have been everybody has but you know most of men cannot be. So the bottom line is you don't want to suppress or react to when you suppress you kind of have it here. I think in the United States even worse like they showing weakness. So they really repressed oppressed and um the eventually explode then they become very dangerous and the other kind is the reactive so they are become violent because they got so much pressure they couldn't help them become violent didn't say that you but I say when you see something should be emotional but you don't you become the habit you need to watch out letting them but you have a very good head that mean you can let inspiration coming down they can change your behavior they're very difficult is they have a totally open but this one is color so they can be experience but they don't experience because their head is so strong they have this
*   they don't really accept new things if your head have color means it's hard to accept new things yes they are they are very open minded they are like stubborn so break is good right yes That is the 50% we all open like this together only 2% because they are very unique. They have a purpose to to shoot. Only unique This is halfway. Sometimes support What's that? All right. Bye. with other people. So this is two sentence, right? So it's interesting result. I can see that just Oh yeah. The body So the GPS of greatness. The conditions Okay. Sorry. Inner child. Okay. Sounds like a voice. I don't know. Spectrum show. One more time. One hour. Okay. Mhm. Okay. How many Is this foreign speech. We are Okay. Find a big I saw you comfortable. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I think Anyone else? I'd like to know your opinion about two things I have ever heard so far. One is uh that people say everything happens for a reason
*   and the second one is just like uh you said that life can be changed but you have to work really really hard to alter your destiny. What's your opinion about this? Yeah the first one I agree. Yeah because one of the fears is attractor. So before we come down we design okay purpose for this trip what do I want so that attraction will start to work so everybody you attract experience actually those people will come to your dream so everything happened for a reason we decided I want to be independent make my own money going outside right so you have this match then the second I told you life is not working hard on the wrong track just like on the wrong track
*   if you don't The flow is to be right but we choose to someone say there is better we believe it but we have to prove it. So the first 40 years we always just follow that we want to work on our own until one say the other side they're
