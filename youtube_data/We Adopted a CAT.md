## 📝 影片文字稿

### 🐱 收養決定
We don't know if we're going to use this video or not, but we are here to *adopt* a cat potentially. Potentially cat. We don't know yet because we have to figure out if I'm allergic to it or not. Yes. So hopefully my body can accept the cat. I hope so. Okay.

### 🏠 迎接 Beimo
So we ended up *adopting* the kitty that we *mentioned* before. This is Beimo. Basically we have been thinking about getting a cat for about a year now, and we knew we wanted to like *adopt* a cat rather than like buy one. And we wanted an adult cat, not a kitten. We've been following this online group for about a little over half a year, and we just we were kind of keeping an eye on the post about animals who needed homes.

### 📖 Beimo 的背景故事
He *popped up* one day probably about a week ago and I was like "Wow, he's a really sweet cat." The previous owner, basically the guy who was taking care of him, was super nice guy and he said that Beimo was left at a *vet clinic* when he was about 6 months old. And the first owners had already like *neutered* him and even declawed him, which is something I wouldn't personally do myself. I don't agree with declawing surgery, but he's not sensitive about it. He's fine and he has his all of his *vaccinations* and everything like that.

### 🎁 收養過程
So that guy took him in and fostered Beimo for a while, but he's moving back to America soon so he was trying to find a more *permanent* home for him. So we ended up uh taking in Beimo and the guy was really nice. He gave us like all the *supplies* that he had like a cat carrier and litter box and even like food and things like that.

### 🤧 克服過敏問題
Cuho managed to *overcome* his cat *allergy* a lot. I think spending a whole month at a time in Canada every day around my family's cat, your immunity kind of built up to it. And also all all my friends start to have pets. That's when it started to change for me. That's when... Yeah, that's actually when it started to change when your best friend got a cat. Yeah, that's all you could talk about. I've grown up with cats my whole life in Canada and the only time I haven't had one was after moving to Korea.

### 😍 幸福時光
So he loves you. You look like you're in heaven right now, so warm. It's making me sleepy.

### 🌸 春天的對比
So I'm going to kind of do this to tease my parents because in Nova Scotia right now it's like the middle of April right, but they've just got their second snowstorm within like 2 or 3 days and my dad has been sending me pictures and there's just a blanket of snow everywhere. So we wanted to show them our version snow. It's our version of snow. This time here the lilacs blooms. So just a little my parents... My dad's going to laugh so hard.

### 🛒 購買貓糧
We're going to get some cat food today. We're walking to EMart now and we're going to see what kind of variety they've got. We already we were given his cat food that his previous owner has. So we have a whole bunch of that. But it's really cheap actually, especially when you get it online. These days we just like order online. Yeah, even our own cuz they just like *deliver* to our house. We can actually save time and money.

### 🦐 新玩具
I get this shrimp pencil case in Japan. I was using it up until he took a liking to it. So I put catnip on it. He's like a dog.

### 🍳 料理時光
H I'm going to cook papu. It's Chinese food. What I'm going to make is kind of Korean style. Oh I don't know. Actually style. Yeah, my style.

Wow, it's really starting to rain. M Yeah, it's just kind of a rainy gloomy day. So we're just going to take it easy and kind of relax this weekend a little bit.

Oh gosh. What i think we don't have enough minced garlic. I think it's really going to be Cuba style since we don't have actual *ingredients*. What are we missing? I don't know what it is. Instead I'm going to use pepper powder. M garlic but we don't have enough. So I'm just going to use all soy sauce. This is the sauce. There's so many dishes in the sink.

Yeah, I feel like it's way more common to cut vegetables with scissors in Korea. I love it. He's curious what you're doing. Put water potato starch. So you add water to the potato starch. Dubu mixed with rice.

### 🌧️ 雨夜陪伴
This is what our rainy nights are going to look like now. Yeah, it's raining really really hard and we're just all three of us laying together here watching some Netflix.

### 📛 關於名字
If you type Beimo in Google images you'll see how actual Beimo looks like. Yeah, we didn't name him actually. We thought it would just be easier for him to *adjust* if we kept his name that his previous owner gave him, but we think it's cute anyway so we just kept Beimo. I think it's from Adventure Time.

### ☀️ 完美的早晨
So this is Sunday morning. We couldn't *release* the video until we captured this moment. He's the friendliest cat I've ever met. You're too close.
