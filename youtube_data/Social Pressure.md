hi hello it's been a long time since we've done a talking video.

This is actually a topic that we have been talking about over the last couple months or so, so we wanted to talk about *social pressure* and *life expectations*—basically, expectations from society that you're kind of expected to live your life this way at particular stages in your life. If it deviates from this kind of structure, a lot of people think it's strange or unusual, and that's what we wanted to talk about.

Your mom mentioned people in her generation: if somebody was unmarried or chose not to get married, everyone thought they were strange and they were kind of ostracized. It was really weird, like there's something wrong with them just because they chose to go down a path that differs quite a bit from, I guess, the... I don't want to say typical, but just the social norm.

You know, you go to school, you graduate, you get a job, you get married, you have kids, you retire—like that's kind of this social construct that people have. If someone's life *differs a little bit from* that system, I feel like (and everyone's guilty of this) people don't really know how to process it if it *deviates from* that idea that has been so ingrained in us since we're kids. Because they've seen people living like that, they think *that's always the way* to live it, right? That's the right way, that's the safest way.

Obviously, some people just want to try something new. Some people just want to live somewhere else and try to build a new business, whatever. But I just want to say that's all their choices—it's not wrong. If no one ever tries new things, then there shouldn't be any new business in the world.

Exactly. And again, we're not saying if your goal in life is to follow this social construct, we're not saying, "Oh, this is boring." No, we're definitely not saying that. If that is what will make you happy in your life and that is your choice, that's great! But if you happen to be someone who thinks, "Oh, that's really not for me," that's fine too. You can also choose something else. It's all about choice and basically choosing a path for your life that fits you, rather than worrying about *pleasing other people* and worrying about other people's expectations all the time. Because *at the end of the day*, you're going to have to live with those decisions the most.

I know many young people are struggling, especially in this generation. In Korea, probably over 80% of high school students go to universities, and then after graduation, they decide to go to a company. When I was also graduating university, my parents asked me, "Why don't you just go to a company and earn money, save money, have a baby?" They live the life they lived—my dad was working in a company and my mom was a housewife. But I told my dad, "What if you weren't a businessman? What if you worked for the government, for example? Would you still recommend me to work for a company or recommend me to work for the government?" Because in his point of view, that would be the safest life.

I'm not saying whatever my dad gave me as advice is wrong—because how he lived, he thinks that's the perfect way to live. But for me, I just didn't want to take that same path. I wanted to try something different. I saw too many other things, mixed with other cultures, and just for me, staying in one place wasn't good enough.

That's important, what you said, because *I feel like the most important thing* I have to *keep reminding myself* with this kind of thing is: everyone's definition of happiness is different. As humans, we want people to experience all the great things we've experienced—"Oh, I've done this and this is so great, you have to do it too!" But sometimes people don't experience things *the same way you did*, and that's just the bottom line. It may be too different from their interest or their personality or anything. They perceive differently.

But sometimes people don't experience things *the same way you did*, and that's just the bottom line. It may be too different from their interest or their personality or anything. They *perceive* differently.

So I don't think it's fair for even parents to force their kids to do the same thing they did. I think they should give more options and find out what the kid really likes to do and what kind of happiness he desires.

Anyway, we've been doing this YouTube for over a year and we got actually a lot of questions in the comment box—people asking, "When are you going to have a kid?" This is probably our most asked question. Of all the questions we get asked, one pops up: we get questions a lot about kids, like, "Your kids will be really cute!" "When are you having kids?" "I can't wait to see your kids!" "Your kids will be so cute!" "I hope I can see your kids soon!" What's interesting to us is that we've never once said that we wanted to have kids or that we are having kids, but because of this kind of social construct, people assume that we are. Actually, we've chosen not to, and we're not going to *justify* it and explain why, but it's just our personal decision and it's just not for us. We chose not to. But it's questions like that—I know it's *unintentional* that people kind of assume these things.

Even then, the question starts with "when"—most of them are "when," not like "Are you thinking of having kids?" or "Would you like kids someday?" But so many of them are "when"—they're just asking the time, right? It's like, "When are you graduating? When are you going to get a job?" I think that's why people don't realize it, but that really stresses and gives a lot of pressure to our generation. Some people, for example, students, want to graduate and want to get a job, yes, but it's not the right question to ask: "When are you going to get a job?" or "You're 30 or 31 years old, when are you going to get married?" How do you know if that person wants to get married? Many people these days choose not to get married.

Even my mom's a teacher—my mom owns the bakery academy and she has a teacher who also didn't want to get married. She's very talented and well qualified, she enjoys her time, she always travels, she plays guitar, she meets with people, goes to concerts, and the way she lives, she's just *fully satisfied.* I don't think anyone should judge about that, saying, "Think about your parents." In Asian countries, it's the hardest, it's a difficult topic because we do have *circumstances* where children should follow what parents usually say, and if we disobey, we feel like it's a *taboo*, right? If you go against their wishes or expectations, it's obviously not all of them—some people are more open about it, some people don't really mind—but if that kind of pressure is held for kids, then the kid is going to live forever with those decisions. What's going to happen if the kid, when he reaches 50 years old, looks back and thinks, "What have I done with my life?" Like, "This wasn't my life." Is he going to just be sad the rest of his life? Is he going to blame his parents, like it was their decision? Well, it's too late.

I think it is really important to know what you really like and what kind of life you want to live. If you don't think that's suitable for you, then you should convince your parents.

I wanted to add something on to your mom's friend. Especially in her generation, when she made that choice not to get married, I can pretty much guess the kinds of things that people would have said to her. I feel like a lot of people *scolded her*, but a lot of people said, "You're going to regret that decision later, you're going to *miss out* on this wonderful experience and marriage, and you're never going to have any kids, like poor you." I mean, she *gets fulfillment* in a different way. She feels life fulfillment, she's not empty, she's not *deprived of anything*. *Just because getting married and having kids made someone else really happy and fulfilled does not necessarily mean it will do so for somebody else.* Everyone is so different—why do people judge each other and say, "You're going to regret that, you're going to miss out on this"? Because everyone—this is all relative. No one is going to experience this the same, no one all has to fit into the same kind of likes and dislikes in life stages to be considered normal, functional people in society who are worthy. I mean, it would be boring if everyone was the same.

Anyone who's getting questions like, "What are your grades like? What university are you going to? *You're getting older*, when are you going to get married? You've been married for a year or two, when are you going to have children? When are you going to give your kid a sibling?"—these are just all the same questions being asked: "when, when, when, when, when," because *this is what is supposed to* come next in your life, and *you're being weird for not doing this.*

*It's not just as easy as saying "ignore it."* I feel like everyone goes through this kind of thing, but step back and just feel confident in your decision and what you know is right for you at the end of the day. Because if you make your decisions constantly *based on what other people expect of you*, then I think you're going to live *quite miserably* because you didn't live life the way you wanted to live.

Yeah, please, this is not like 2010. I'm sorry, we're all different. We all get happiness and fulfillment from different things. So I guess at the end of this video, our main message was: no one is required or *obligated* to live a certain life just because society expects it, or their relatives expect it, or their friends expect it, or anyone expects it. It's just all of these things are choices, and you have to choose the ones that are right for you, because it's your life and this is going to be all your experience.

So Z was about to answer that question. So again, I know we already said this before, but this kind of social norm—we're not saying if you choose to live that life or if you've lived it, it's bad or boring. It's not what we're trying to say. *The whole point of* our video is: people are *entitled to* their life choices. I wish that we would all be a little less judgmental of people's decisions and their different paths in life, and we have no right to judge, really. For us, this is what I wanted to do, so we *came up with* a conclusion to do these things. I hope whoever watches this video also can make their own choices, right? So I guess that's it. Yeah, that's about it. I think we got all that out there. Yes. All right, we'll see you next week and have a great week. Bye guys, bye.

So anyway, today we wanted to talk about *life expectancy*—that's like how long you're supposed to live. The life expectancy for women in Korea is like 83 years old. So what we are trying to say is that...
