#### Interview with Director James Gunn

**Interviewer (Peggy):** David, Rachel, I'm Peggy from Peggy for Show. So I'm named after you, I gather! It's great to see you.

**James Gunn:** You too!

**Peggy:** You're well known in Taiwan for directing *superhero* movies. So this time with you directing Superman, did you face any new *challenges* in terms of actions or more emotional or dramatic scenes?

**James:** Yeah, I did. You know, I think one of the first *challenge* I faced was - you know, you just said I'm known for directing superhero movies. And that's true, but when you think about it, I've never directed a superhero movie because I directed a movie called "Super," which is really about a crazy guy who puts on a superhero costume. 

I directed the Guardians movies, which are these crazy space adventures. They really aren't superheroes - they don't wear masks or have really have superpowers of any type. Then I did the Suicide Squad, which they're super villains. They aren't superheroes at all!

So the hardest thing was directing a superhero movie even though I'm *famous* as being a superhero director, because Clark is pure. He is a hero. He is that *stalwart* figure, and to be able to write for that character and not feel boring was a *challenge* for me.

#### About Krypto the Dog

**Peggy:** How did you *approach* a character like Krypto, or maybe I should ask how did you even direct Krypto?

**James:** Well, Krypto - I mean, so Krypto is based on my dog. My dog is Ozu. He's a *rescue* dog and he's a just a terrible, terrible dog! So the easiest character to write was Krypto because I just wrote my dog. If my dog had superpowers, then my house would look like an ant farm.

**Peggy:** So what it looked like in the ice castle - was that how your house really looked like?

**James:** Well, if my dog could fly through walls, yes! But yeah, when you see the table knocked over and all that stuff - no, that's nothing compared to what Ozu has done. He's gotten better, but he was really, really bad.

#### Superman's Vulnerability

**Peggy:** The film opens by showing that Superman losing a battle for the very first time. What made you decide to start the story this way and what made you decide to share this side of him?

**James:** Well, I knew that I wanted a story that had *stakes*. People all have different feelings about who Superman should be. Some people want him to be so *powerful* that he can punch through a planet and beat up God. But a lot of people want to know that even though he's the most powerful superhero in the world, that he can still be beaten. He's still *vulnerable*.

And so right at the beginning of the movie we're like, "Oh yeah, this guy's bleeding. He's in the dirt. He has to be saved by his ragamuffin dog. He's definitely - the stakes are real in this movie." So that's really where that came from.

#### Easter Eggs and References

**Peggy:** And will there be any nods to previous Superman movies, maybe like iconic lines or funny Easter eggs or cameos?

**James:** There's a couple little things like that that refer to previous Superman stories. Actually going back even longer to like the Max Fleischer cartoons and the George Reeves TV show from the '50s. So yeah, there's a couple little things in there that are fun for Superman fans.

**Peggy:** We're really looking forward to that! Thank you so much!

#### Interview with Rachel Brosnahan (Lois Lane)

**Peggy:** Hello! How are you? I'm Peggy from Peggy for Show. So my first question will be for Rachel. You're well known in Taiwan for playing women who are strong, fearless, and not afraid of taking any challenges. So this time as Lois Lane in a world full of unknown and threats, as a human being without any superpowers, how did you *portray* this role and how did you *approach* this character?

**Rachel:** Well, I think she's kind of an everyday superhero. I think *journalists* are everyday superheroes. She has the power of the pen and she takes it seriously, and she takes the *responsibility* seriously.

And so I feel like it was just about figuring out what makes her tick. As an actor, I love playing women who are *obsessive* and being pushed to the brink of their own humanity in some way. And Lois is a character who will quite literally leap into the fire to get the best story. And so I guess in some ways I understood that, and then also had the *opportunity* to talk with some real life journalists who I was really inspired by.

#### Interview with David Corenswet (Superman)

**Peggy:** And for David, this is your first time playing a superhero, and Superman is not just incredibly powerful, but he also carries the weights of people's *expectations* and hopes. How did you *prepare* for a role like this?

**David:** I think the way that Superman deals with the expectations and hopes of the people that he serves is by taking *responsibility* for whatever actions are necessary. He doesn't think too much about the bigger picture or the second or third order consequences. He focuses on what needs to be done right now, and he takes on the important responsibility of "I'll be the one to do that, and if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I'll take the action that seems necessary to take."

And I try to do that in my own life. I think it's important for people to recognize the things that are within their control and to act on them. And so that was one way in for me.

#### Personal Connection to the Role

**Peggy:** What does playing a hero mean to you? Did it change or inspire you in any way?

**David:** It's a good question. I think there's a dad element to our Superman that I really appreciate and relate to. The sense that he's a little bit corny and a little bit like - you know, you might roll your eyes at some of his jokes, but boy, you sure are glad when you're stranded somewhere at 1:00 a.m. at a party you don't want to be at, that you can call him and he'll come and pick you up. Dad will take you home.

Yeah, and I call dad all the time! So I really liked getting to embody that a little bit. I just - I had a kid. My wife had a kid about a year and a half ago, right before we started shooting. And so I was coming into both of these sort of fatherly roles at the same time.

**Peggy:** You were kind of like that before?

**David:** Yes! I've been a dad for a long time. I just was waiting for a kid to prove it!

#### Final Thoughts

**Peggy:** The next question will be for both of you. What would be an *exclusive* scoop for the audience of this movie?

**Rachel:** Oh gosh! Well, I'm actually playing Lois Lane. Am I allowed to say that? Spoiler alert! There's a dog in the movie.

**Peggy:** No, we know that!

**David:** Now all I can think about is your musky suit. No, don't, don't, don't!

**Rachel:** By no means an exclusive scoop. I think what's exciting about this movie is that there's something in it for everyone. There's big action, epic adventure. There's a beautiful love story in it. I think we're excited to see what different audiences take away because I feel sure that no two people are going to take away the same thing from this movie.

**David:** So we haven't seen it yet. I guess that's why we don't have any...

**Rachel:** Yeah, we don't know what's in there!

**David:** Yeah, we're looking forward to that.

**Peggy:** Thank you so much!
