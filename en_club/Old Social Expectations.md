### Topic: Old Social Expectations Still Suitable for Modern Life


#### 1️⃣ What are some common social expectations or beliefs you grew up hearing from your family or society? (你成長過程中聽到的常見社會期望或信念有哪些？)

When I was young at school, teachers always told us to study hard and pass exams to get into a good university and secure a good job in the future. Back then, I always tried to be a good student. But honestly, I wasn’t the best in my class — I just tried not to be the worst, so I could feel safe in some way.



  - People often said that a man should have a stable job and buy a house before getting married.(人們常說男生結婚前要有穩定工作、買房才行。)

  - In my family, getting married before thirty was seen as a must for women, or people would gossip about you.(在我家，女生30歲前結婚是必須的，不然就會被人八卦。)

  - Society told us that having a high salary and good title means you’re successful.
      (社會告訴我們高薪和好職位就是成功。)

  - Many people believe you should live a “normal life”: study, work, get married, have kids — in that order.(很多人認為人生就該按照「讀書、工作、結婚、生小孩」這個順序走。)

---

#### 2️⃣ Which social expectations (like “marry by 30” or “study hard”) have made you feel stressed or conflicted? How did you deal with them?


   - Yes. When I turned 30 and was still single, I started getting a lot of questions from relatives at family gatherings. It made me very uncomfortable.(有，當我30歲還沒結婚，家族聚會就一直被問，超不舒服。)

   - I felt pressured when people expected me to follow a stable career path, but I actually wanted to start my own business.(人們期望我走穩定的職業路線，但我其實想創業，壓力很大。)

   - I felt stressed because society makes you feel like a failure if you don’t own a house by a certain age.(社會讓你覺得如果某年齡前沒買房就很失敗，壓力很大。)

   - People told me I should have kids after marriage, but I don’t really want children.(人們說結婚後就該生小孩，但我其實不想要小孩。)

👉 當你面對這些「社會價值觀」帶來的壓力時，你怎麼面對、處理？

   - I learned to ignore those opinions and focus on what makes me happy.(我學會忽略那些意見，專注於讓自己快樂的事。)

   - I talked to my family and friends about my feelings, and they were supportive.(我跟家人朋友談了我的感受，他們很支持我。)

#### 3️⃣ Which social expectations do you think should be kept, and which ones should be changed? Why?

   - I think respecting others’ opinions is important, but people should also respect different life choices.(我覺得尊重別人的意見很重要，但人們也應該尊重不同的生活選擇。)

   - The idea of working hard is valuable, but success shouldn’t only be measured by salary or material things.(努力工作是有價值的，但成功不應該只用薪水或物質來衡量。) 

   - The belief that women must marry young should be completely thrown away. Everyone should decide for themselves.(我覺得女生一定要年輕結婚的觀念應該完全丟掉，每個人都應該自己決定。)

   - I think encouraging financial independence is good, but not everyone has to buy a house to be considered “successful.”(我覺得鼓勵經濟獨立很好，但不是每個人都需要買房才能被認為是「成功」的。)
