## 個人經驗分享

**Jake**: So Rachel, I got to ask, have you ever tried copying actors when you're learning a language?

**Rachel**: Oh my gosh, yes! Actually that's how I learned most of my Spanish. I used to watch telenovelas and just repeat everything they said.

**Jake**: That's awesome! Did you feel silly at first?

**Rachel**: Um, totally! I remember standing in front of my mirror trying to copy this dramatic scene and my roommate walked in. She was like "What are you doing?"

**Jake**: No way! That's hilarious! But you know what? That technique actually has a name. It's called **shadowing**.

**Rachel**: Ooh, shadowing! I love that. It sounds so professional.

**Jake**: Right! So for our **Jake**: Right! So for our listeners who don't know, shadowing is when you listen to native speakers and repeat what they say at the same time. It's like being their shadow.

**Rachel**: Exactly! And movies are perfect for this because actors speak so clearly. Plus you get to see their facial expressions and body language.

**Jake**: That's such a good point. When you watch someone speak, you can see how they move their mouth, where they put their tongue.

**Rachel**: Mhm. And actors are trained to project their voice, so their pronunciation is usually crystal clear.

**Jake**: Well, most of the time. Have you ever tried shadowing with someone who has a really thick accent?

**Rachel**: Oh wow, yeah! I once tried copying Robert Downey Jr. in one of his movies and I sounded ridiculous.

**Jake**: Which movie?

**Rachel**: I think it was, um, one of the Iron Man films. He talks super fast and has this really specific way of speaking.

**Jake**: Ah, I know what you mean! That's actually a great point for beginners: Start with actors who speak clearly and not too fast.

**Rachel**: Exactly! Like if you're just starting out, don't jump straight into a Christopher Nolan movie where everyone's mumbling.

**Jake**: That's so true!

## Shadowing 技巧詳解

### 基本步驟

**Jake**: Okay, so let's break this down. What's the best way to actually do shadowing with movies?

**Rachel**: Well, first you definitely need subtitles, at least when you're starting.

**Jake**: Yeah, and I'd recommend English subtitles, not your native language. You want to connect the sounds with the English words.

**Rachel**: Good point! So here's what I usually do: I pick a short scene, maybe two or three minutes long.

**Jake**: Ooh, short scenes are key! Don't try to shadow an entire movie on your first try.

**Rachel**: Right! Then I watch it once without doing anything. Just absorb it, you know?

**Jake**: Mhm. Get familiar with the rhythm and the emotions.

**Rachel**: Exactly! Then I watch it again and try to speak along with the actors, even if I mess up, which I always do at first.

**Jake**: Oh, everyone messes up! That's totally normal. The trick is to not stop. Just keep going even if you fall behind.

**Rachel**: Yes! And here's something I learned: Don't worry about understanding every single word at first.

**Jake**: That's huge! Focus on the rhythm and the melody of the language.

**Rachel**: Exactly! English has this up and down pattern. And when you copy actors, you start to feel that rhythm naturally.

**Jake**: And the more you do it, the more automatic it becomes. It's like your mouth learns the movements.

**Rachel**: Ooh, I love that! "Your mouth learns the movements." That's so true!

## 選擇演員的建議

**Jake**: So what about choosing which actors to copy? Any tips there?

**Rachel**: Well, I always tell people to pick actors they actually enjoy watching. If you find someone boring, you're not going to stick with it.

**Jake**: That makes sense. But also think about the type of English you want to learn, right?

**Rachel**: What do you mean?

**Jake**: Like if you want to sound more American, maybe pick American actors. If you prefer British English, go with British actors.

**Rachel**: Ah, good point! Though I have to say, mixing accents can be fun too. I know someone who speaks with this weird British-American hybrid because she learned from both.

**Jake**: That actually sounds kind of cool, like her own unique accent, right?

## 實用技巧分享

**Rachel**: Anyway, um, let's talk about some practical tips. Jake, what's your favorite shadowing technique?

**Jake**: Okay, this might sound weird, but I like to exaggerate everything at first.

**Rachel**: Ooh, what do you mean?

**Jake**: Like if an actor raises their voice, I raise mine even more. If they emphasize a word, I really emphasize it.

**Rachel**: That's brilliant! Because then when you tone it down, it still sounds natural.

**Jake**: Exactly! It's like if you practice running with weights, running without them feels easy.

**Rachel**: I love that analogy! And you know what else helps? Recording yourself.

**Jake**: I hate listening to my own voice, but yeah, it's super useful.

**Rachel**: I know, right? But when you compare your recording to the original, you can hear exactly where you need to improve.

**Jake**: And be patient with yourself. Don't expect to sound like a native speaker after one week.

**Rachel**: Oh, definitely! This is a long-term thing. But the cool part is you'll start noticing improvements pretty quickly.

**Jake**: Yeah! Like after a few weeks, people might start saying "Hey, your English sounds really natural."

**Rachel**: And that feeling is amazing! It's like all that practice suddenly clicks.

**Jake**: So true!

## 電影推薦

**Rachel**: Okay, before we wrap up, any movies you'd recommend for shadowing practice?

**Jake**: Well, we can't suggest the usual ones because we covered those in previous episodes, right? No Forrest Gump or Finding Nemo this time.

**Rachel**: So I'm thinking, what about something with clear dialogue but still entertaining?

**Jake**: Hm, you know what? I think **The King's Speech** would be perfect.

**Rachel**: Oh wow, yes! That's brilliant! I mean, it's literally about improving speech, so it's super relevant.

**Jake**: And Colin Firth speaks so clearly in that movie.

**Rachel**: Plus it's got this inspiring story about overcoming challenges.

**Jake**: Exactly! And there are lots of scenes with repetition and speech practice, which is perfect for shadowing.

**Rachel**: Plus you get to hear different British accents, which is great for training your ear.

**Jake**: The only thing is some of the dialogue is quite formal, but that's actually good for learning proper pronunciation.

**Rachel**: True! And the movie's just really well-made. You won't get bored watching the same scenes over and over.

**Jake**: Definitely!
