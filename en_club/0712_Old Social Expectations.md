### Topic: Old Social Expectations Still Suitable for Modern Life


#### 1️⃣ What are some common social expectations or beliefs you grew up hearing from your family or society? (你成長過程中聽到的常見社會期望或信念有哪些？)

#### 🌸my answer:
*study hard, get a good job.*
When I was in high school, teachers always told us to study hard, get into a good university, and find a good job in the future. Back then, I always tried to be a good student. But honestly, I wasn’t the best in my class — I just tried not to be the worst, so I could feel safe and secure in some way.


*speaking English is important.*
Besides, when it comes to English in Taiwan, people believe that being able to speak English is very important. If you can speak English well, you can gain more opportunities in your career.




#### 🌸other persepctives:

  - People often said that a man should have a stable job before marriage.

  - In my parents’ generation, it was common to get married by 30 and have kids soon after.

  - Many people believe you should live a “normal life”: study, work, get married, have kids — in that order.

#### 2️⃣ Which social expectations (like “marry by 30” or “study hard”) have made you feel stressed or conflicted? How did you deal with them?


#### 🌸my answer:

**getting a job immediately after graduation.**
Yes. When I graduated from university, I joined the army for one and a half years. After that, I started looking for a job. It was difficult to find one at that time due to the economic situation.

But luckily, I didn’t get much pressure from my parents. Instead, they were supportive and encouraged me to carry on and look for a job patiently. But you know, somehow I just want to get a job quickly and to meet the social expectations.


*family responsibilities.*
I just popped into a question in my mind: For men, what if your wife's salary is higher than yours? How would you feel? Likewise, for women, what if your husband's salary is lower than yours? How would you feel?

In my family, my dad earns money for a living, and my mom takes care of the household. It works okay for my family.


answer: For me, I believe that in a marriage, both partners should support each other, regardless of who earns more. It’s more about teamwork and sharing responsibilities, not just about money.


*gap year*
In many Western countries, some young people take a gap year to travel, either after high school or after working for a few years.

I think this is a good idea because it allows people to explore the world and discover their interests before carrying on with their careers. 

In Taiwan, however, taking a gap year is not common and is often seen as a waste of time. People usually go straight from school to work.


 

#### 3️⃣ Which social expectations do you think should be kept, and which ones should be changed? Why?


#### 🌸my answer:

**interests and passions**
I think that during childhood, studying hard is not a bad thing, but it should not be the only focus. We should also explore our interests and passions. If you are truly passionate about something, you will naturally want to learn more about it.



#### 🌸other persepctives:
   - I think respecting others’ opinions is important, but people should also respect different life choices.

   - The belief that women must marry young should be completely thrown away. Everyone should decide for themselves.

   - I think encouraging financial independence is good, but not everyone has to buy a house to be considered “successful.”
