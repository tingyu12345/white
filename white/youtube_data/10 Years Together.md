#### Introduction to Q&A
Hi guys, a couple weeks ago we asked you guys on Instagram, it's our ten year since we started dating, the anniversary coming up very soon. So we thought we'd do a little relationship Q&A. Some questions were about like our relationship in particular and some just like general relationships, conflicts, international marriage and relationships, things like that. So we're gonna get right into these questions. I hope you guys enjoy this video.

#### Food Culture Appreciation
**Q: Who loves each other's food culture more?**
- Cuho with Canadian food or Sarah with Korean food?
- I guess equal, yeah. I would definitely say it's equal. We both love each other's food culture. For me it's a whole new world, different flavor, different spices. You lived in Russia so you're used to Western style breakfasts and things like that.
- Early dating time, I had a hard time eating spicy food. I had to train her, yeah. Slowly I built up my *tolerance* and it got even better than yours. And then I got chronic gastrointestinal cancer... so here we are. So it was all for nothing.

#### Cultural Surprises When Meeting Parents
**Q: Cultural surprises when meeting each other's parents?**
- Korean culture and Canadian culture are really different when meeting each other's parents.
- I was very *intimidated* by how formal the whole thing is. The age hierarchy in Korea, when you introduce your partner to your parents, it's kind of implied you are interested in marriage. In Canada, your parents just say, "Bring your girlfriend over for dinner," not an engagement.
- I was shocked there's no title, your mom just told me to call her Debbie. For me that was a huge culture shock. *I can never picture* calling your parents by their first name. In Korean culture, there's still a line between in-laws. But I felt I could be just me in front of your parents, even more sometimes.
- You are absolutely yourself in front of my parents for sure. He's just like the adopted son whenever we go to Walmart, that's what people probably think.

#### Qualities Cherished in Relationship
**Q: Qualities of your relationship you cherish the most that made you decide to settle down?**
- It's just how you made me feel, how you treated me, and how we were able to communicate. *It's hard to find someone you're that compatible with* on those levels.
- And I could just be me. That's a big one. *I don't have to act in a certain way or hide something*. I could just be me and she saw me and loved me as who I am and respected me. That was always a big thing for me.
- Trust. We talk about everything with each other. We're not just husband and wife, we're also best friends.

---

#### Maintaining a Happy and Healthy Relationship
**Q: How to maintain a happy and healthy relationship with your partner or spouse?**
- Always communicate well. *Don't expect the partner to read your mind.* You have to say things if you have a problem. Don't hold it in.
- **Don't go to bed angry.** If you had a fight, talk about it before going to bed. We did it once and it felt awful, never did it again.
- Show appreciation for small things. Don't take each other for *granted*. For example, bringing a snack the other person *craves*, even without mentioning it.

---

#### Dealing with Parental Disapproval
**Q: What if your parents don't like the person you love?**
- *First ask what would be the reason? Sometimes parents see things you don't. Find out the problem and talk about any miscommunication or misunderstandings.*
- If it still doesn't work and you truly think this person is the one, go for it. You're going to live with this person, not your parents. If you *dump* that person because your parents said so and marry someone else, what if you're not happy? Will you blame your parents forever?
- Try to figure out why, and if you still think this person is the one, make your own decision.

---

#### Favorite Random Qualities
**Q: Your favorite random quality you love about each other?**
- I really love your laugh, it's very. When I make you laugh, I feel good because I made a good joke. You always told me you're *self-conscious* about your laugh, but I really love it.
- I personally like when I see you saving small animals or bugs. Even last video, you tried to save a worm and a praying mantis. For some people, they might just go by or step on it, but you stop and save them. You said, "It's nothing hard for me, but it can be really hard for them, so why not save them?"

---

#### Solving In-laws Problems
**Q: How did you solve in-laws problems?**
- In-law culture in Canada and Korea is extremely different. In Canada, it's *hands-off*, couples are their own family units and have privacy. In Korea, you marry the family, not just the person. It can be too much *involvement* for a Westerner.
- The most important person to play a role is the contagiousKorean partner. If the man is Korean, he needs to *stand up for* you and talk to his parents. Definitely needs boundaries. *The earlier* you and your partner create those boundaries with the in-laws, the better. At first, there will be pushback, but you have to be firm.
- If not dealt with at the beginning, the partner will *build up stress and resentment*, which is not good for the marriage. Talk about it firmly *as early as possible.*

#### Biggest Obstacles for International Marriage
**Q: What's the biggest obstacle for international marriage?**
- **Location:** Where are you going to live? One partner will have to make a big sacrifice and live in the other's country, away from family, friends, native language.
- **Children:** Where to raise them, what language, what culture? International school tuition is expensive. Most friends who are international couples move back to Canada or America to raise kids.
- **Language Barrier and Job Opportunities:** Not with your partner, but with in-laws or society. If not fluent, job opportunities are limited.

---

#### Talking About Finances Before Engagement
**Q: Before you got engaged, when and how did you speak about finances?**
- When dating, I was still paying off my student loan. I never hid that from you. We were broke, living in a one room for five years. It just happened gradually. We work together, so we know the income. I use a budget app to track *expenses and income*. We always tell each other before buying something, even jeans. We're not *impulsive spenders*.

---

#### Favorite Part About Being in an International Marriage
**Q: What is your favorite part about being in an international marriage?**
- Option to live in partner's country. I get to eat partner's country's food and desserts. Deep talks about cultural differences *make conversations interesting*.

---

#### Native Koreans' View on International Marriage
**Q: How do native Koreans view your international marriage? Do you feel much prejudice?**
- We live in Seoul, larger foreign population. Never been looked down at or sworn at. One ajishi gave a thumbs up when I said, "She's my wife." Grandpa didn't like it at first, but now loves Sarah.

---

#### Handling Conflicts or Fights
**Q: How do you handle conflicts or fights?**
- **99% of the time, we talk about even small issues before they turn into a fight.**
- No one is a mind reader, *you have to express what you're feeling* in a non-angry way. Never name call. If there's an argument, don't walk out or go to bed angry, talk and *diffuse the situation*. Communication is always the most important thing between partners.

---

#### A Quirk About Each Other You Grew to Love
**Q: A quirk about each other that you grew to love?**
- Cuho has a way of putting his pants on lying down like a four-year-old. Sometimes we're having a serious conversation while getting dressed and I can't take it seriously. I've learned to love it.
- Sarah always *sniffs food* before eating, like a dog. Sometimes her nose touches the food. I tease her about it, but she doesn't realize until I start laughing. It helps enhance her taste buds.

#### Closing Remarks
Thank you so much for all the questions guys, we really enjoyed talking about this. Maybe in the future we might do this kind of video again, Q&A, because there were a lot of great questions. Sorry we couldn't *cover all of them.* We would love to talk about relationship and international relationship things in general. The most important thing: communication, trust, and not taking anything for granted.

Thanks for watching, see you guys very soon!
