hi hello it's been a long time since we've done a talking video This is actually a topic that we have been talking about over the last couple months or so so we wanted to talk about social pressure and life expectations basically like expectations from society that you know you're kind of expected to live your life this way at particular stages in your life and if it deviates from this kind of structure it's kind of a lot of people think it's kind of strange or unusual and that's kind of what we wanted to talk about your mom mentioned people in her generation if somebody was unmarried or they chose not to get married everyone thought they were strange and they were kind of you know ostracized and it was really weird like there's something wrong with them just because they kind of chose to go down a path that you know differs quite a bit from I guess the I don't want
 want to say typical but just the social Norm you know you you go to school you graduate you get a job you get married you have kids you retire like that's kind of this social constract that people have and if someone's life differs a little bit from that kind of system I feel like and and everyone's guilty of this I feel like people don't really know how to like process it if it deviates from that idea that we have that has been like so ingrained in US since we're kids then it's kind of I think um be because they've seen people living like that they think that's always the way to live it right yeah that's the right way yeah that's the right way and that's the safest way obviously some people just want to try something new some people just want to live somewhere else and try build a new business whatever but uh I just want to say that's all their choices it's not like wrong or if no one ever
 tries like that kind of new things then there shouldn't be any new business the world exactly and again we're not saying if your goal in life is to follow this social construct we were talking about we're not saying oh you know this is boring and this is no no we're definitely not saying that kind of thing if that is what will make you happy in your life and that is your choice that's great but if you happen to be someone who you think oh you know that's really not for me mhm that's fine too like you can also choose something else it's all about choice and basically choosing a path for your life that fits you rather than worrying about pleasing other people and worrying about other people's expectations all the time cuz at the end of the day you're going to have to live with those decisions the most I know many young people are struggling especially in this generation that uh and as you guys probably know uh in Korea probably like over 80%
 % of high school students go to universities and then after the graduation of University they they decide to go to the company but uh when I was also um graduating University my parents also asked me like why don't you just go to the company and earn money save money have a baby the they live yeah the life they lived because uh my dad was working in a company and my mom was a house housewife but I told my dad what about Dad what if you weren't a businessman what if what if you work for the government for example would you still recommend me to work for the company or just recommend me to become you know work for the government or something because that might be in his point of view that would be the safest life I mean I'm not saying like whatever my dad gave me the advice is wrong
 because how he lived he thinks that's the perfect way to live but um for me I just didn't want to take that same path I just wanted to I wanted to try something different I just I don't know I saw too many other things and just mixed up with other culture and just for me just staying in one place wasn't good enough yeah that's important I think what you said because I feel like the most important thing that I have to keep reminding myself with this kind of thing is like everyone's definition of happiness is different and I know like as humans we want people to experience like all the great things that we've experienced and you know oh like I've done this and this is so great you have to do it too you have to experience this but I mean sometimes people don't experience things the same way you did and that's just the bottom line it may be too different from their interest or their personality or anything
 yeah they perceive differently so uh I don't think it's fair for even for parents to force their kids to do the same thing that what they did yeah right um I think they should give more options and find out what the kid really likes to do and what kind of Happiness he desires anyway we've been doing this YouTube for over a year and we got actually a lot of qu uh questions in the comment box people asking when are you going to have a kid and this is probably our most asked question of of all the questions we get asked one pops up like we get uh questions a lot about kids MH and like your your kids will be really cute yeah it's always you know oh when are you having kids I can't wait to see your kids your kids will be so cute I hope I can see your kids soon and what's interesting to us is that we've
 never once said that we wanted to have kids or that we are having kids but because of this kind of social construct people assume that we are and actually we've chosen not to and like we're not going to justify it and explain why but you know it's just our personal decision and it's just not for us and we chose not to but it's questions like that I know it's unintentional that people kind of assume these things yeah yeah even then the question starts with when when yeah most of them are when not like oh are you thinking of having kids or would you like kids someday but so many of them are when they're just asking the time right yeah it's like uh when are you graduating when are you going to get a job and I think probably that's why people don't realize it but that really stresses and that gives a lot of pressure to like our generation right some people like for example um students want to
 graduate and want to get a job yes but it's not the right question to ask when are you going to get a job or you know you're 30 or 31 years old when are you going to get married how do you know if that person wants to get married many people these days choose not to get married even even my mom's a teacher my mom owns the bakery Academy and she has a teacher and she also she didn't want to get married and she's very talented and she is very well qualified she enjoys her time she always travels she plays guitar she meets with people go to concert and the way how she lives she's just fully satisfied and right I don't think uh anyone should judge about that saying like think about your parents and well I know probably in Asian countries it's the hardest it's a difficult topic because um we do have kind of circumstances where
 children should follow what parents usually say and we disobey things we feel like it's like a taboo right if you kind of go against their wishes expectations it's obviously not all of them some people are more open about it some people don't really mind but uh if that kind of pressure is held for kids then well the kid is going to live forever with those decisions what's going to happen if the kid when he riches 50 years old and then he thinks like he looks back and what have I done to my life yeah like this was in my life is he going to just be sad the rest of his life is he going to blame his parents like it was their decision well it's too late I think um it is really important that to know what you really like and what kind of life you want to live if you don't think that's suitable for you then you should convince your
 your parents I wanted to add something on to your mom's friend okay and I feel like especially in her generation when she made that choice not to get married I can pretty much guess the kinds of things that people would have said to her M I feel like a lot of people scold her but a lot of people like you're going to regret that decision later you're going to like miss out on this wonderful experience and marriage and you're never going to have any kids like poor you I mean she gets fulfillment in a different way yeah she feels life fulfillment she's not empty she's not deprived of anything just because you know getting married and having kids made someone else really happy and fulfill does not necessarily mean it will do so for somebody else Everyone is so different why do people kind of Judge each other and say you're going to regret that you're going to miss out on this because everyone this is all
 all relative no one is going to experience this the same no one all has to fit into the same kind of likes and dislikes in life stages to be considered normal functional people in society who are worthy I mean you'll be boring if everyone yeah yeah exactly anyone who's getting questions like what are your grades like what university are you going to you're getting older when are you going to get married you've been married for you know a year or two when are you going to have children when are you going to give your kid a sibling like these are just all these same questions are being asked like when when when when when because this is what is supposed to come next in your life and you're being weird for not doing this I mean it's it's not just as easy as saying ignore it I feel like everyone goes through this kind of thing but kind of step back and just kind of feel confident in your decision and what you know is right for you at the end of the day because if
 you make your decisions constantly based on what other other people expect of you then I think you're going to live quite miserably because you didn't live life the way you wanted to live y yeah please this is not like 2010 I'm sorry we're all different we all get happiness and fulfillment from different things so I guess at the end of this video our main message was no one is is required or obligated to live a certain life just because Society expects it or their relatives expect it or their friends expect it or anyone expects it it's just all of these things are choices and you have to you know choose the ones that are right for you cuz it's your life and this is it's going to be all your experience so Z was about to answer that question so
 so again I know we already said this before but this kind of social Norm we're not saying if you choose to live that life or if you've lived it it's bad or boring it's not what we're trying to say the whole point of our video is people are entitled to their life choices I wish that we would all be a little less judgmental of people's decisions and their different paths in life and like we have no right to judge really for for us this is what I wanted and say I wanted to to to do these things too so we came up with a conclusion to do these things I hope whoever watches this video also can make their own choices right so I guess that's it yeah that's about it I think we got all that out there yes all right we'll see you next week and have a great week bye guys bye so anyway today we wanted to talk about life expectancy
 that's like how how long you're supposed to live the life expectancy for like women in Korea is like 83 years old so um what we are trying to say is that
