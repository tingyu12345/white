### 你會如何評價在台灣的生活
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cePqpufRg4Q&t=14s


Thank you so much for your time, and the first question is where are you from and how long have you been here? I'm from Austria, I was born and raised in Vienna, and I've been living in Asia for three years now.

Three years ago, how's your life so far? My life is pretty good, I feel very safe and yeah, it's a nice environment to be living and I'm very grateful.

Okay, what brought you to Taiwan in the first place? Work. I was working in Hong Kong before and I would fly around between Taiwan and Hong Kong, and then I decided to come here and just in time because right after I came to Taiwan, the pandemic started, so I was stuck here basically.

But I also feel like it was a good place to be stuck in and I felt very, you know, taken care of and safe.

I see, what do you do? I'm in modeling.

Modeling, yeah, obviously.

Yeah, I'm actually at work now, this is my **lunch break**, so I look a little sorry to bother you. Didn't notice it's my lunch break and yeah, very lucky to run into you guys because you have been here for a couple of years right? So how would you rate living in Taiwan? One out of ten, and what about the good thing and a bad thing?

Wow, one out of ten, this is hard. No, I want just one, to be honest. Yeah, sure, **eight**. I think there are a lot of things that are incredibly comfortable about living in Taiwan. I feel very safe, the environment is very safe, Taipei is very green, and it's a beautiful place.

I really like, I think one of my favorite things is how people are very **considerate and thoughtful.**

**It always seems like** people are looking out for each other. I never feel like people are **taking advantage of the fact** if they think that like I'm a tourist. I don't feel like people raise the prices for me like they do in many other countries.

People **tend to be very humble and honest and straightforward**, and if you lose something, every day when I walk around I see keys and wallets, and people just pick them up and put them on the side, so if you lose something, you come back a few hours later, it's probably still there.

Ah, yeah, so I really, oh my God, I love that so much. And the whole island is just very, it's convenient to get anywhere. There's a high-speed rail, it's like one and a half hours to Kaohsiung, and then you can go to the beach. There are the mountains, **a lot of beautiful nature**, Hualien, Taroko National Park, Kenting has beautiful beaches. Like I said, Kaohsiung is a **gorgeous** place. She's the one cheating and then of course you have the new one, so the whole coast, upper North Coast, Eastern Coast.

I feel like **there's a little bit of everything here.** The food is amazing, it's very cheap, oh my God, I feel like **it's cheaper to eat out than to cook at home sometimes.** If you buy the ingredients, you might as well just go to a night market, and you know, people are very sweet and it's a good experience all around.

Yeah, so sounds good. So, what about the bad part because it's still not perfect, right? But I think there's nothing, there's no perfect country, but I want to talk about like a more specific like bad part of Taiwan or have you ever experienced like a bad experience, something like that?

Uh, yes, of course, and you're completely right, no country is actually perfect, **everything has got its pros and cons.**

I feel like sometimes in Taiwan, I feel a bit **isolated from people**. I feel like it's very hard to get into groups because they seem to have been established from **very early on**, and people like to **stay within their circles**, **it seems to me.**

And also a lot of people, it's a very **homogeneous** culture, usually I feel like everywhere I go people look at me like I'm the first foreigner they see. Like even now in 2022, you know, people look like, "Oh my God, look, **waiguoren**, oh my God".

And people don't seem to travel as much, and be, I mean, they're very open-minded, they're very **tolerant and welcoming**. Everywhere I go, "Welcome to Taiwan," it's so cute.

And I wish that people were, they got more chances to travel as well and be more just see more of the world. I feel like maybe because Taiwan is also an island, people tend to be more kind of isolated from the rest of the world **in a sense.**

So a lot of people I met have never really traveled before, and **the ones** that do travel, they usually stay with the group like tour groups.

And I feel like where do they go? Japan, right?

So in Japan and Taiwanese culture can be quite similar sometimes, so people when I meet them they seem to have not have seen a lot of the world, and sometimes they struggle with English as well.

So I wish that there could be **more of** a connection sometimes, so maybe there's another reason **I find it hard to** break into circles here or to **amass** a lot of friends.

Yeah, I'm actually half Taiwanese.

Oh, so you're half Taiwanese, oh.

Thank you so much for your time. Where are you from and how long have you been here? I'm from Chicago in the US, and I've been here four and a half years.

Four and a half, well that's quite long.

Yeah, so what brought you to Taiwan in the first place? I've lived a few other places before I moved here and I wanted something different, and I lived in Asia before, then I moved to Europe, and I wanted to come back to Asia, so I felt like Taiwan was a good way to do that.

How would you rate living in Taiwan as your opinion? Score one out of ten?

Hmm, I think it depends on which qualities I'm like judging. I think overall, for me, **I have a pretty easy and comfortable lifestyle compared to living in the states.** I think I wouldn't be able to have the same lifestyle in the states as I do here.

And also I like nature, I like doing things outside. And like I said, it's easy to do those things, just get on the bus maybe an hour **or so** and you're at those locations.

So for comfort, being comfortable, I would say eight and a half, that's pretty high.

Yeah, so what about a good thing and a bad thing? Well, the obvious bad thing is that my Mandarin is not great.

So I feel like, but that's my own fault, you know, I live in Taiwan, I could practice more, but I think that does leave a little bit of a barrier because I should know more because that's the language of this country.

But I think the good part is with that, I still have a challenge for myself to be able to learn and grow and to do something, so even though I don't know much Mandarin, I still have many Taiwanese friends who help me and introduced me to different things so not completely lost.

So what is your current Mandarin level do you think? Baby.

Yeah, that's it, that's it. Thank you so much.

Where are you from and how long have you been here? So I'm from the USA. I've been here since January of this year, so almost 11 months, and I'm from San Francisco, New York.

How's your life so far? I love it in Taiwan, it's a great place to live.

I've lived in China, I've lived in U.S., and I've lived in many cities, and Taipei is just a very **livable** city, and my kids love it here, it doesn't really feel like a foreign country to us.

How would you rate living in Taiwan, one out of ten? So, can you also tell about a good thing and bad thing?

Okay, so definitely a ten.

There are so many great things, one is the level of English, you can always find somebody who speaks English.

I **happen to** speak Mandarin, so that makes it a little bit easier to get along, but there's beautiful, untouched nature, mountains to climb, beautiful shoreline, hiking, biking.

It's very biking friendly with lots of nice trails, you can actually go all the way around the island on a bike trail.

In addition, there's great shopping, you can get the types of things that you are used to buying in your home country **as far as clothes and apparel.**

The food's amazing here, a lot of like night markets where you can try the traditional Chinese Taiwanese foods.

It's easy to get around, it's inexpensive. I'm really trying to search for something bad, it's, I can't.

You know, it is kind of hard to find some of the foods from your own country sometimes.

Yeah, so you just have to create it on your own like I haven't been able to find blue cheese dressing, so I just make that at home.

But, uh, yeah, **very few negatives that I can even think about.**

Do you have anything you want to share to the audience or anyone they want to come to visit Taiwan? Yeah, come visit, it's a beautiful place.

Very friendly, very easy to get around, you know, whether it's inexpensive taxis or the subways, here they have a really great public transport system.

And they have great, if you have children, they have great summer school programs where you can just come and stay for the summer where your kids can learn Mandarin in the summer camps at the universities here.

Yeah, that's it, thank you so much, thank you, thank you so much sir, thank you.
