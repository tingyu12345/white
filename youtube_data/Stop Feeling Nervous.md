### Stop Feeling Nervous When Speaking English!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80qce33cq4U

Hello everyone, welcome to a new episode of Bose's Slow English!

It's been one week since I've posted a long YouTube video. I was experimenting with posting one YouTube short per day. I had a live stream, and I seemed to have worried many of my subscribers because I went from posting one long video per day to zero. So I'm sorry if I scared you. I've been very busy with work, so I wanted to make sure that I was able to balance my work life and my YouTube life. That's why I posted shorts. Please check them out if you are interested in mastering English.

Today's topic is about confidence—how to build confidence when you are just **starting out with** learning English, and eventually when you speak to a native English speaker. I want you to feel confident in your speaking abilities, and I think that my suggestions today may be a little bit **different from what you'd expect.**

I hope the speed in which I'm speaking right now is okay for you. I'm trying to be not too slow and not too fast—I'm trying to be in the middle while pronouncing very clearly.

I also have some very exciting news: I am offering one-on-one coaching for English teachers! So if you are an English teacher from anywhere in the world and you are interested in maybe starting a YouTube channel or creating some digital products such as ebooks, I would love to consult with you. I will leave a link below and I look forward to connecting with English teachers, whether you live in the United States or you live abroad.

**Confidence**

What does it mean to be confident? I'm sure there are various dictionary definitions. My definition of confidence means that you approach a situation, or you talk to someone, or you do something where you are fully in your own power. What I mean by that is **you don't care what other people think.**

I've learned a lot about myself, and my confidence as a human being has increased **ever since** I joined YouTube, ever since I started my YouTube channel. When I first started out, I was confident in my niche. (A niche is the style and topic of video and your channel. So my niche is: I teach English.)

I was confident that I wanted to create an English channel on YouTube in vlog style because I thought it was a unique angle compared to English teachers who teach with a very academic classroom style. I am not saying that my method or my style is more **superior** or better compared to a classroom style. I personally, as a language learner myself, enjoy a vlog style video. So I tried to put myself **in the shoes of** English students by remembering what my needs were as a French and Korean student.

To put yourself into someone else's shoes—this is an excellent idiom to know. It means that you envision yourself (envision, like in your brain you see yourself or you imagine yourself) as that person. So I was envisioning myself being in an English student's shoes so that I could figure out what exactly my niche should be.

My confidence level when I was first starting out on YouTube was like this: I had confidence, and then I didn't, and then I had confidence, and then I didn't. Because in the beginning, I was unfamiliar with all the different technology and the websites and the platforms and how to streamline my process. (Streamline means to be efficient and come up with a system so that every time you do this task, you do it with a structure and it's easy to do each time, basically.)

So I didn't know how to film a vlog. I only had my phone. I did not have this awesome vlogger camera. I didn't know how to edit a video on an editing software—I currently use Cap Cut. I didn't know how to create thumbnail images, which are the cover photos of my videos, so then I had to learn Canva and basically become like a fake graphic designer. I didn't understand YouTube SEO or titles or tags or descriptions or hashtags. I didn't know how to post and when to post. There's so much I didn't know, and every time I thought I mastered something, there was more that I needed to learn. So my confidence level dipped, but I kept doing it.

The way that my brain works is: I know if I put myself in an uncomfortable situation daily, I will grow each time. If I have stress or anxiety about the unknown or something that I don't know the future of, I will do it because I want to control the future of that. The only way for my future to be controlled is if I try it, if I attempt it. So I wouldn't say every day my confidence level went up with my YouTube channel. I would say every month my confidence level went up little by little. And now I'm just past the one year mark, and I would say I'm very confident in my niche, my channel. I believe in what I do. I trust myself. I have streamlined a system. I understand how to edit and create thumbnails, etc. But if I think about how I was one year ago, my confidence level was much lower compared to now.

As a human being, I would say since I'm in my 30s now, my confidence has increased with time because I've started to care less and less about what other people think. I know I have a lot of subscribers on here between the ages of 25 and 40. I would like to share the importance of only thinking about yourself. Don't compare yourself to others and be mindful of your surroundings. All of this has really helped me to be where I am in my confidence now.

So I should say, actually, the reason why I want to talk about this topic is because I was on my YouTube live stream today and one of my awesome subscribers said, "You are someone who is very strong." And I said, "Thank you." Strong can mean different things. It can mean I'm physically strong. It could also mean I'm mentally strong. But be careful—do not tell someone that they have a strong personality. They will be highly offended, because when you tell someone they have a strong personality, it means that they are too direct or too forward, and what they say and the energy that they have is offensive. So don't say you have a strong personality. Instead of saying that, you have a strong mind, which is fine to say. You could say, "You have a lot of confidence," which is generally a good thing to say. But confidence for me did not happen overnight.

For anyone who is interested in getting onto YouTube, I recommend to keep a commitment of one year. You have to commit to YouTube and consistency for one year and give yourself the opportunity to succeed.

A lot of you talk about how you lack confidence in speaking English. That's normal. But I will repeat myself:

**Number one:** Don't worry about what other people think about your accent. Don't change your accent. Keep your accent—it makes you unique. It is cool to be unique now. But focus on your grammar, but don't overthink it, because the person—the native English person that you're speaking to—they will understand the gist of what you're saying. (Gist is the overall intention.)

**Second of all:** Try not to be a perfectionist. If you strive for perfection, you will really set yourself up for failure. So just speak what you know. Don't try to be perfect with your grammar. And ask the person that you're speaking to, if they are a native English speaker, if they could kindly correct you if your grammar is wrong. If you ask for permission or invite them to provide light corrections, they would be happy to do it from a very kind place.

**Number three:** I know a lot of you mention that when you speak, your vocabulary is simple and you want to sound more complex. You want to have more complex vocabulary. Pump the brakes—which is an idiom meaning slow down. You don't have to learn complex vocabulary overnight. Just speak what you know. Add one new word every day. Write down an example sentence using that word. Read it out loud. And don't give yourself a hard time because you speak with very simple terms. There's nothing wrong with that.

I love my English learning community here. Please leave a comment and teach your fellow students here: What tips and tricks do you have to build your confidence when speaking English? I think it would be great if all of you contributed to this comment section here.

If you enjoyed my video and if you would like to master English further, I have awesome ebooks that I made just for you. The link will be in the description. I have slang books—the topics are about love, workplace, and everyday slangs. So if you want to sound like a native English speaker, you need to know all these words. In each book, I have a special bundled price, so if you purchase all three books, you'll get a special price.

And if you really want to upgrade your English, I have a 90 phrasal verb ebook. Phrasal verb is really important to sound like a native English speaker, such as: "I'm picking up this pen," "I am standing up," "I am sitting down." Do you know all of these terms? There's 90 in this ebook that I made, or you can grab the free copy and the link will be below as well.

I hope you enjoyed today's lesson. I'm sorry that I have been absent, but I promise you I have been posting some short videos every day, so check those out. I'll see you next time. I appreciate you beyond words. Thank you. Bye.
