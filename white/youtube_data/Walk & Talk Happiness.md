### Walk & Talk Happiness 😊

The reason why I wanted to make this 影片 is because I read everyone's comments. Thank you everyone who does submit a comment on here! I know that there's a lot of bad things happening in this world and it touches my heart to hear that my 影片 bring joy to your day. It actually really helps to motivate me to post 影片 every day to try and bring that joy to your life.

Sometimes it's hard to see joy when you are surrounded by sadness, anger, and negativity. There's a lot going on in Los Angeles right now as far as violence, anger, negativity. I am luckily safe, my neighborhood where I live is safe, so I am extremely grateful for that.


Let's just do a walking meditation today together and focus on the things that make us happy.

- Number one thing for me lately is I'm so happy to have a positive influence on people around the world. I've made a lot of friends. I just hit 35,000 subscribers!
- When I have a tough day at work at my full-time job and then I come home and I read your comments—the comments that say "I'm going through a tough time, times are difficult right now especially what's happening in the world, but your 影片 make me happy"—I actually cry when I read those comments. I'm not going to cry right now but I do get very emotional when I read those comments.

To be very honest with you (and I hope my boss doesn't see this), some days at work my work feels like I don't have a lot of purpose there. I mean, obviously there's purpose for me there, but when I come home from work I am able to recharge my energy even though when I'm at work I feel absolutely exhausted. **I think feeling exhausted comes from doing a job that I don't love to do,** because what I love to do is help people like you guys.

So anyway, I'm happy to have my YouTube channel and to have my community and my friends. **It makes me feel like I have a new purpose in life.**

I am grateful to have **a roof over my head** (這是一個片語，意思是我很高興有地方住)


> **manifest** 是另一個單字，意思類似 karma（業力），就是你很想要某件事，並且一直祈禱、思考它，最終吸引它發生。
