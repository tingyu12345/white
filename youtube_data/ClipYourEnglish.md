## 個人經驗分享

Jake: So Rachel, I got to ask, have you ever tried copying actors when you're learning a language?

Rachel: Oh my gosh, yes! Actually that's how I learned most of my Spanish. I used to watch telenovelas and just repeat everything they said.

Jake: That's awesome! Did you feel *silly* at first?

Rachel: Um, totally! I remember standing in front of my mirror trying to copy this dramatic scene and my roommate walked in. She was like "What are you doing?"

Jake: No way! That's *hilarious*! But you know what? That technique actually has a name. It's called shadowing.

Rachel: Ooh, shadowing! I love that. It sounds so professional.

Jake: Right! So for our Jake: Right! So for our listeners who don't know, *shadowing is when you listen to native speakers and repeat what they say at the same time*. It's like being their shadow.

Rachel: Exactly! And movies are perfect for this because actors speak so clearly. Plus you get to see their facial expressions and body language.

Jake: That's such a good point. When you watch someone speak, you can see how they move their mouth, where they put their tongue.

Rachel: Mhm. And actors are trained to project their voice, so their pronunciation is usually *crystal* clear.

Jake: Well, most of the time. Have you ever tried shadowing with someone who has a really thick accent?

Rachel: Oh wow, yeah! I once tried copying Robert Downey Jr. in one of his movies and I sounded ridiculous.

Jake: Which movie?

Rachel: I think it was, um, one of the Iron Man films. He talks super fast and has this really specific way of speaking.

Jake: Ah, I know what you mean! That's actually a great point for beginners: Start with actors who speak clearly and not too fast.

Rachel: Exactly! Like if you're just starting out, don't jump straight into a Christopher Nolan movie where everyone's mumbling.

Jake: That's so true!

## Shadowing 技巧詳解

### 基本步驟

Jake: Okay, so let's break this down. What's the best way to actually do shadowing with movies?

Rachel: Well, first you definitely need subtitles, at least when you're starting.

Jake: Yeah, and I'd recommend English subtitles, not your native language. You want to connect the sounds with the English words.

Rachel: Good point! So here's what I usually do: I pick a short scene, maybe two or three minutes long.

Jake: Ooh, short scenes are key! Don't try to shadow an entire movie on your first try.

Rachel: Right! Then I watch it once without doing anything. Just absorb it, you know?

Jake: Mhm. Get familiar with the rhythm and the emotions.

Rachel: Exactly! Then I watch it again and try to *speak along with the actors*, even if I mess up, which I always do at first.

Jake: Oh, everyone *messes up*! That's totally normal. The trick is to not stop. Just keep going even if you *fall behind*.

Rachel: Yes! And here's something I learned: Don't worry about understanding every single word at first.

Jake: That's huge! Focus on the rhythm and the *melody* of the language.

Rachel: Exactly! English has this up and down pattern. And when you copy actors, you start to feel that rhythm naturally.

Jake: And the more you do it, the more automatic it becomes. It's like your mouth learns the movements.

Rachel: Ooh, I love that! "Your mouth learns the movements." That's so true!

## 選擇演員的建議

Jake: So what about choosing which actors to copy? Any tips there?

Rachel: Well, I always tell people to pick actors they actually enjoy watching. If you find someone boring, you're not going to *stick with* it.

Jake: That makes sense. But also think about the type of English you want to learn, right?

Rachel: What do you mean?

Jake: Like if you want to sound more American, maybe pick American actors. If you prefer British English, go with British actors.

Rachel: Ah, good point! Though I have to say, mixing accents can be fun too. I know someone who speaks with this weird British-American *hybrid* because she learned from both.

Jake: That actually sounds kind of cool, like her own unique accent, right?

## 實用技巧分享

Rachel: Anyway, um, let's talk about some practical tips. Jake, what's your favorite shadowing technique?

Jake: Okay, this might sound weird, but I like to exaggerate everything at first.

Rachel: Ooh, what do you mean?

Jake: Like if an actor raises their voice, I raise mine even more. If they emphasize a word, I really emphasize it.

Rachel: That's brilliant! Because then when you tone it down, it still sounds natural.

Jake: Exactly! It's like if you practice running with weights, running without them feels easy.

Rachel: I love that *analogy*! And you know what else helps? Recording yourself.

Jake: I hate listening to my own voice, but yeah, it's super useful.

Rachel: I know, right? But when you compare your recording to the original, you can hear exactly where you need to improve.

Jake: And be patient with yourself. Don't expect to sound like a native speaker after one week.

Rachel: Oh, definitely! This is a *long-term thing*. But the cool part is you'll start noticing improvements pretty quickly.

Jake: Yeah! Like after a few weeks, people might start saying "Hey, your English sounds really natural."

Rachel: And that feeling is amazing! It's like all that practice suddenly clicks.

Jake: So true!

## 電影推薦

Rachel: Okay, before we wrap up, any movies you'd recommend for shadowing practice?

Jake: Well, we can't suggest the usual ones because we covered those in previous episodes, right? No Forrest Gump or Finding Nemo this time.

Rachel: So I'm thinking, what about something with clear *dialogue* but still entertaining?

Jake: Hm, you know what? I think The King's Speech would be perfect.

Rachel: Oh wow, yes! That's brilliant! I mean, it's literally about improving speech, so it's super *relevant*.

Jake: And Colin Firth speaks so clearly in that movie.

Rachel: Plus it's got this inspiring story about overcoming challenges.

Jake: Exactly! And there are lots of scenes with repetition and speech practice, which is perfect for shadowing.

Rachel: Plus you get to hear different British accents, which is great for training your ear.

Jake: The only thing is some of the dialogue is quite formal, but that's actually good for learning *proper* pronunciation.

Rachel: True! And the movie's just really *well-made*. You won't get bored watching the same scenes over and over.

Jake: Definitely!
