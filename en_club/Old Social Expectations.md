### Topic: Old Social Expectations Still Suitable for Modern Life


#### 1️⃣ What are some common social expectations or beliefs you grew up hearing from your family or society? (你成長過程中聽到的常見社會期望或信念有哪些？)

#### 🌸my answer:
When I was in high school, teachers always told us to study hard, get into a good university, and find a good job in the future. Back then, I always tried to be a good student. But honestly, I wasn’t the best in my class — I just tried not to be the worst, so I could feel safe in some way.

Besides, when it comes to English in Taiwan,people believe that being able to speak English is very important. If you can speak English well, you can gain more opportunities in your career.




#### 🌸other persepctives:
  - People often said that a man should have a stable job and buy a house before getting married.(人們常說男生結婚前要有穩定工作、買房才行。)

  - In my parents’ generation, it was common to get married by 30 and have kids soon after.(在我父母那一代，30歲結婚、生小孩是很常見的事。)

  - Many people believe you should live a “normal life”: study, work, get married, have kids — in that order.(很多人認為人生就該按照「讀書、工作、結婚、生小孩」這個順序走。)

#### 2️⃣ Which social expectations (like “marry by 30” or “study hard”) have made you feel stressed or conflicted? How did you deal with them?


#### 🌸my answer:
Yes. When I graduated from university, I joined the army for one year and eight months. After that, I started looking for a job. It was really hard to find a job at that time due to the economic situation.

But luckily, I didn’t get much pressure from my parents. Instead, they were very supportive and encouraged me to look for a job patiently.but you know, somehow I just want to find a job quickly and to meet the socail expectation.


#### 🌸other persepctives:
   - start my own business(創業) 

   - need to have a stable job(需要有穩定的工作) before marriage(結婚前)

   - People told me I should have kids after marriage, but I don’t really want children.(人們說結婚後就該生小孩，但我其實不想要小孩。)


 

#### 3️⃣ Which social expectations do you think should be kept, and which ones should be changed? Why?


#### 🌸my answer:




#### 🌸other persepctives:
   - I think respecting others’ opinions is important, but people should also respect different life choices.(我覺得尊重別人的意見很重要，但人們也應該尊重不同的生活選擇。)

   - The idea of working hard is valuable, but success shouldn’t only be measured by salary or material things.(努力工作是有價值的，但成功不應該只用薪水或物質來衡量。) 

   - The belief that women must marry young should be completely thrown away. Everyone should decide for themselves.(我覺得女生一定要年輕結婚的觀念應該完全丟掉，每個人都應該自己決定。)

   - I think encouraging financial independence is good, but not everyone has to buy a house to be considered “successful.”(我覺得鼓勵經濟獨立很好，但不是每個人都需要買房才能被認為是「成功」的。)
